= Strategy =

This document outlines iMarc’s strategy process, methods, and deliverables. The strategy process incorporates practices from UX, IA, needs analysis, and even sales and business development.

iMarc is a full service web agency located north of Boston. Learn more at http://imarc.net.



== Process ==

The strategy process is provided to clients who have signed a proposal which includes a specified time and cost budget for strategy.

=== Beginning Strategy ==

Strategy begins with an internal handoff meeting between the proposal author and strategy team. Proposals that do not call out a strategy budget or scope should be turned down by the strategy team.

The proposal author then makes it clear to the client that leadership is changing hands and the lead strategist is now their primary point of contact.



=== Goals ===

Strategy builds upon previous discovery and must fulfill the terms of the proposal or SOW. Strategy should sanity check recommendations from the proposal with client needs, overriding those recommendations and changing course where necessary and agreeable with the client.

Strategy produces a plan for production teams that is realistically possible within all project constraints. The work should clarify the project for the client and center around a positive end user experience.

When proposals specify a time or cost budget for the production phase, strategy deliverables must define a project that can be easily produced within those limitations. 

The strategy lead is responsible for delivering change orders when the scope of the strategy phase, or the production work that strategy is defining, changes.



=== Approval ===

The output of strategy are concrete reference documents. Deliverables are approved by the client and iMarc producer. 

Approved deliverables are handed off to the project’s Interactive Producer. The strategy lead then makes it clear to the client that leadership is changing hands and the Interactive Producer is now their primary point of contact.



== Deliverables ==

**Project Scope** is defined by a //Proposal// or by a //Statement of Work//. "Scope" means how many hours are allocated to the project's phases, and any mandatory features. Scope is restated in the //Functional Spec// or //Technical Spec//

**Project Requirements** are defined by a //Functional Spec// or a //Technical Spec//.

**Project Implementation** is defined by a //Technical Spec//.


=== Proposal ===
 - Is created by BizDev
 - Is a sales tool
 - Defines project scope
 - Recommends features and functionality
 - Includes background research & discovery

=== Statement of Work (SOW) ===
 - Is created by Interactive Producers or BizDev
 - Is not a sales tool. SOWs are used for existing clients who don't need to be sold on iMarc as a vendor.
 - Defines project scope
 - Defines features and functionality
 - Usually does not include background research and discovery
 - Usually does not require a specification before production


=== Functional Specification ===
A 5-10 page document for smaller projects with a production scope less than 200 hours.

The Functional Spec takes about 60 hours to produce, including all discovery, research and meetings.

 - Created by Strategy team or delivered by the client
 - Not a sales tool
 - Restates scope of production phase
 - Must be approved by the client
 - Describes business needs driving the project
 - Describes front-end functionality (what, not how)
 - Typically includes the following [#SupportingDocuments supporting documents]
   - site map
   - homepage narrative
 - Reviewed by Interactive Producer before finalization
 - May include or reference change orders vs the proposal scope


=== Technical Specification ===
A 15–80 page document for projects scoped to a 200+ hours production schedule. iMarc used to call this a "Functional Requirements Document (FRD)".

Typically takes 90–170 person-hours to produce, including all discovery, research and meetings.

 - Created by Strategy team
 - Not a sales tool
 - Restates scope of production phase
 - Must be approved by the client
 - Includes everything in a Functional Specification, plus:
   - Describe back-end functionality such as CMS tools, fields and relationships; databases; network and server infrastructure; external systems the site works with; security considerations.
   - Must be reviewed by Interactive Producer and an engineer before finalization
   - May also be reviewed on an ad hoc basis by UX, Creative, BizDev or others identified by Producer or Strategist


== Supporting Documents ==

The Functional Specification or Technical Specification commonly include:

==== Discovery Report ====
Brief document summarizing findings, including: 
 	- Business overview, including services and customers
 	- Target audiences
 	- Project goals, prioritized // (e.g., new business development, recruiting, membership growth, industry influence...) //
 	- Project challenges // (e.g., competitors, company differentiators, technical isssues...) //
 	- Notable trends in site analytics
 	- Client interview and/or survey results // (if conducted) //
 	- Baseline performance/analytics // (including conversion rates, if possible) //
 	- Prioritized objectives
 	- Initial recommendations

The discovery document is typically 3-6 pages long. The primary purpose of this document is to ensure all stakeholders are aligned to the same objectives and priorities. Secondarily, it serves as a "checklist" of sorts for the next documents: site map, wireframes, specifications.



==== Homepage Narrative ====
Brief, 1-2 page document that defines all content, features and functionality required for the homepage. This simple list and description acts as a starting point for the design and creative phase.



==== Site Map ====
Diagram showing the relationship of a web site's information. They are crucial to project planning and scope and are used throughout the project lifecycle. 
 	- iMarc uses site maps to convey content hierarchy, dynamic and CMS controlled content, and template usage.
 	- Site maps create a navigational backbone for a website.
//Example: // \\
 	[[img(/wiki/sup/img/sitemap.png, Sample Site map)]]


==== Wireframe ====
User interface illustration stripped of all presentational style.
 	- Allows for rapid, efficient UI iteration
 	- Convey what a screen does, not what it looks like
 	- However, design is inexlicably linked to layout, so a UX Engineer or Creative should be consulted on wireframes, and often will be the principal authors
 	- Multiple wireframes are often produced to express various parts of the site

=== Software & Templates ===

iMarc currently uses [http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle OmniGraffle Pro] for site maps and wireframes, but previously used a program called Inspiration. OmniGraffle is Mac-only software.

(At least one Interactive Producer uses Microsoft Visio for Windows; OmniGraffle can import/export those files.)

iMarc generally uses the [http://konigi.com/tools/omnigraffle-wireframe-stencils Konigi stencil set] for wireframes. This provides a remarkably complete set of user interface components for web sites, applications and mobile devices.

We usually write reports and specifications in [http://www.microsoft.com/mac/word Word] (which has particularly good change tracking), but are not married to it. (You can download branded templates from [http://internal.imarc.net/ our intranet].) We've used [http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/ Pages] too; the revision tools aren't as robust but it's much better at handling images and styles, less prone to crashing.




== Process: How We (Usually) Do This ==

//In Progress// \\ Uniquely matrix top-line synergy whereas cooperative leadership. Monotonectally seize one-to-one best practices without alternative ideas. 




== Tips ==

//In Progress// \\ Energistically e-enable superior communities through enterprise-wide portals. Progressively re-engineer interoperable ROI for tactical results. Holisticly brand technically sound alignments for real-time data.
