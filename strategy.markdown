# Strategy

This document outlines iMarc’s strategy process and deliverables. This incorporates practices from UX, IA, needs analysis, and business development.

iMarc is a full service web agency located north of Boston. Learn more at http://imarc.net.




## Process

The strategy process is provided to clients who have signed a proposal which includes a specified time and cost budget for strategy. Proposals that do explicitly define a strategy budget or scope should be turned down by the strategy team.

Strategy work should clarify the project for the client and production team while focusing on a positive end-user experience.

The strategy lead is responsible for delivering change orders when the scope of the strategy phase, or the production work that strategy is defining, changes.

### Kickoff

Strategy begins with an internal handoff meeting between the proposal author and strategy team.

The proposal author is responsible for notifying the client that project leadership is changing hands and the lead strategist is now their primary point of contact.


### Goals

Strategy sanity checks recommendations from the proposal with client needs.  Strategy deliverables override recommendations from the proposal where necessary and agreed upon by the client.

When proposals specify time or cost budget for production, strategy deliverables must define a project that can be easily produced within those limitations.



### Approval

The output of strategy are concrete reference documents. Deliverables are approved by the client and iMarc producer who will ultimately lead the production phase.

Approved deliverables are handed off to the project’s producer. 

The strategy lead is responsible for notifying the client that project leadership is changing hands and the Interactive Producer is now their primary point of contact.




## Deliverables

**Project Scope** is defined by a *Proposal* or a *Statement of Work*. "Scope" means how many hours are allocated to the project's phases, and any mandatory features. Scope is restated in the *Functional Spec* or *Technical Spec*

**Project Requirements** are defined by a *Functional Spec* or a *Technical Spec*.

**Project Implementation** is defined by a *Technical Spec*.




### Proposal
 - Is created by BizDev
 - Is a sales tool
 - Defines project scope
 - Recommends features and functionality
 - Includes background research & discovery




### Statement of Work (SOW)
 - Is created by Interactive Producers or BizDev
 - Is not a sales tool. SOWs are used for existing clients who don't need to be sold on iMarc as a vendor.
 - Defines project scope
 - Defines features and functionality
 - Usually does not include background research & discovery
 - Usually does not require a specification before production




### Functional Specification

A 5-10 page document for smaller projects with a production scope less than 200 hours.

The Functional Spec takes about 60 hours to produce, including all discovery, research and meetings.

 - Created by Strategy team or delivered by the client
 - Not a sales tool
 - Restates scope of production phase
 - Must be approved by the client
 - Describes business needs driving the project
 - Describes front-end functionality (what, not how)
 - Typically includes the following [supporting documents](#SupportingDocuments)
   - [site map](#SiteMap)
   - [homepage narrative](#HomepageNarrative)
 - Reviewed by Interactive Producer before finalization
 - May include or reference change orders vs the proposal scope




### Technical Specification

A 15–80 page document for projects scoped to a 200+ hours production schedule. iMarc used to call this a "Functional Requirements Document (FRD)".

Typically takes 90–170 person-hours to produce, including all discovery, research and meetings.

 - Created by Strategy team
 - Not a sales tool
 - Restates scope of production phase
 - Must be approved by the client
 - Includes everything in a Functional Specification, plus:
   - Describe back-end functionality such as CMS tools, fields and relationships; databases; network and server infrastructure; external systems the site works with; security considerations.
   - Must be reviewed by Interactive Producer and an engineer before finalization
   - May also be reviewed on an ad hoc basis by UX, Creative, BizDev or others identified by Producer or Strategist




## Supporting Documents

The Functional Specification or Technical Specification commonly include:




### Discovery Report
Brief document summarizing findings, including:

 - Business overview, including services and customers
 - Target audiences
 - Project goals, prioritized
 - Project challenges
 - Notable trends in site analytics
 - Client interview and/or survey results (if conducted)
 - Baseline performance/analytics * (including conversion rates, if possible)
 - Prioritized objectives
 - Initial recommendations

The discovery document is typically 2-6 pages. The primary purpose of this document is to ensure all stakeholders are aligned to the same objectives and priorities. Secondarily, it serves as a "checklist" of sorts for the next documents: site map, wireframes, specifications.



### Analytics Report

2–10 page document that summarizes website analytics indentifying the most important data pertaining to the upcoming project. The primary purpose of this document is to convey traffic data and trends in an easy to understand summarization.




### Homepage Narrative

Brief, 1-2 page document that defines all content, features and functionality required for the homepage. This simple list and description acts as a starting point for the design and creative phase.




### Site Map

Diagram showing the relationship of a web site's information and organization of content. 
 	- iMarc uses site maps to convey content hierarchy, CMS controlled content, and template usage.
 	- Site maps create a navigational backbone for a website.

*Example:*
![Sample Site map](img/sitemap.png)


### Content Outline

The content outline supplements a Site Map. A content mimics the the organization of the site map, providing 1-2 sentences about the purpose and goal of each page.

*Example:*
![Sample Content Outline](img/content_outline.png)


### Wireframe

User interface illustration stripped of all presentational style.
 	- Allows for rapid, efficient UI iteration
 	- Convey what a screen does, not what it looks like
 	- However, design is inexlicably linked to layout, so a UX Engineer or Creative should be consulted on wireframes, and often will be the principal authors
 	- Multiple wireframes are often produced to express various parts of the site

*Example:*

## Software & Templates

iMarc currently uses [OmniGraffle Pro](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle) for site maps and wireframes, but previously used a program called Inspiration. OmniGraffle is Mac-only software.

(At least one Interactive Producer uses Microsoft Visio for Windows; OmniGraffle can import/export those files.)

iMarc generally uses the [Konigi stencil set](http://konigi.com/tools/omnigraffle-wireframe-stencils) for wireframes. This provides a remarkably complete set of user interface components for web sites, applications and mobile devices.

We usually write reports and specifications in [Word](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/word) (which has particularly good change tracking), but are not married to it. (You can download branded templates from [our intranet](http://internal.imarc.net/).) We've used [Pages](http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/) too; the revision tools aren't as robust but it's much better at handling images and styles, less prone to crashing.



## Research Activities

Depending on budget, a number of research levels can be incorporated
into a project.


### Stakeholder Interviews

Identify and gain consus with the client who the key decision makers are. Even if these people aren't in every meeting, the client team and strategy team should be aware of all people with decision making or veto authority.

Speak with key stakeholders. Understand and document their pain, aspirations, and goals for the project. 

- What are the success metrics?
- Who are the audience segments? 
- Does any existing market research exist?


### Competitive Analysis

A competitive analysis can give customers a view of how their competitors fare on the web. 
This analysis can include:

- Layout - page density, visual impact
- Navigations structure analysis - what forms of navigation are used? (main, breadcrumbs, footer, etc). Is it consistent?
- SEO audit - pages indexed, meta and title info, sitemap XML and robots.txt audit 


### Surveys (Quantitative Data)

Surveys allow us to gather information on a large number of participants, yielding results in quantitative terms. For example, *We found that 83% of participants prefer to book their ferry ride online between 11am and 2pm on weekdays.*

Questions are asked in a close-ended fashion (multiple choice, Yes/No, True/False). This allows for faster answering easy analysis. 

iMarc prefers to use Survey Monkey, a tool that easily displays result patterns.


### User Interviews (Qualitative Data)

Speak to current and/or perspective users by conducting contextual, non-biased interviews. This can relate to UI components, design elements, document flow, feature importance, technical knowledge and more. User interviews can take place in person or remotely over the phone with screen sharing software. 



## Template Meta Info

Strategy deliverables should contain some combination of the following meta information

 - Wireframe title - Each wireframe should be given a title relevant to the template
 - Updated date - When was this wireframe last updated?
 - Version number - Give the wireframe a version number
 - Annotations - Annotations describe behaviors, functionality, etc
 - Author
