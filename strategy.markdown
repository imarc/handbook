## How to use this handbook

Your job is to clearly define the project’s final product for both the client and the Imarc production team, while focused on creating a positive end-user experience. You’ll work with your producer, and probably with UX engineers, web engineers, creatives, and/or UX designers as well.

This handbook provides a reference for the most frequently needed activities and deliverables. We’ll focus on what their goals are and how we do them, but leave out tool-specific notes (i.e., this is not an OmniGraffle tutorial).


## Team Members
For large projects, the strategy team will include most of the following roles. More often, a single person may wear several hats, and only a few people are needed.

### Producer or Project Manager

* Sets high-level milestones
* Consulted on spec and strategy deliverables
* Approves spec doc before production
* Creates change orders when the scope of the strategy phase, or the production work that strategy is defining, changes
* Responsible for obtaining client approvals

### Strategist

* Leads the strategy phase
* Manages most client meetings
* Responsible for presenting deliverables and adhering to timeline
* Sets day-to-day tasks and due dates for team
* Delegates tasks to other team members

### UX Designer

* Produces deliverables and supporting documents
* Participates in discovery activities
* Is consulted on functional requirements & specifications

### UX Engineer

* May participate in discovery and interviews
* Is consulted on wireframes, functional requirements & specifications

### Designer

* May participate in discovery and interviews
* Is consulted on wireframes

### Web Engineer

* Responsible for engineering/technical research
* Is consulted on functional requirements & specifications

The Designer, Engineer and UX Engineer(s) will stick with the project after the strategy phase is complete. This ensures that the Engineer and Designer are familiar with the plan and are prepared to execute. The UX Engineer provides consistency, shepherding the vision architected during the strategy phase and forged in production.


## Process

The overall process typically looks something like this:

1. Define project objectives
2. Conduct discovery and report findings
3. Define content and tools as required
	a. Iterate with client, comparing to objectives frequently

Imarc aims for somewhere between the extremes of [Waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) & [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development). 

Since most of our projects are scoped by feature, we try to define those features before we start development and determine how we will implement them within the time allocated; that’s the Waterfall heritage.

But we know that we won’t know everything even after our discovery, and the design & development process must have flexibility. *Imarc empowers designers and engineers to adapt the requirements to the situation at hand based upon ongoing dialog with the client.*

As you plan the site, keep in mind that not everything must be nailed down in advance. You want to:

* Define the broad strokes of the project
* Do your research to make sure anything you define or require is possible within scope (Web and UX Engineers are invaluable consultants for this)
* Give the designers and engineers the tools they need to understand the project’s goals and content
* Make sure the client understands what they are asking the designers and engineers to create
* Make sure the client can produce their assigned content or functions as well
* Identify risk points and fallback positions
* Keep the project moving steadily forward, avoiding getting mired in [yak shaving](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YakShavingDefinedIllGetThatDoneAsSoonAsIShaveThisYak.aspx) or [alligator wrangling](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/forget,_when_up_to_one%27s_neck_in_alligators,_that_the_mission_is_to_drain_the_swamp).


### The Client's responsibilities:
* Clearly articulate the objectives of the project
* Review Imarc’s discovery findings
* Approve deliverables that will guide designers & engineers in creating the website or app

### The Imarc team's responsibilities:
* Help the client clearly articulate the objectives of the project
* Lead discovery and report findings to clients
* Define what we’re building next

### Tips

You don’t have to document how every part of the website or app will be executed. You *do* have to define *what* they will do. Even if it’s not written down, you and the production team should have a good idea of how that will happen; this helps ensure what you are defining is doable in the time provided. If ever in doubt, talk to the person who will do the work!

The most costly problems (in schedule *and* dollars) in a project almost always happen because someone *did not understand what they were approving*. Your job is not only to get a client to approve each deliverable, but to ensure the approver *understands* them. 

Take the time to thoroughly answer a client’s questions. If you find yourself waving your arms or saying “trust me”, that’s a pretty strong signal that neither the client *nor you* understand the answer.

### Getting approvals
Approvals are slippery; it’s easy to misinterpret an email that just says “looks great!” as approval. You are responsible for clearly telling the client what they are approving, and getting a clear and explicit approval. 

The exact form of the approval is unimportant; what matters is that you and the client agree on what that form is. That might be literally signing a document and emailing or faxing it, or it might be clearly stating in email “I approve the wireframe Homepage-v5.pdf”.

Once approved, the deliverable doesn’t change again without a very, very good reason. Because of this, you may find that a client is reluctant to approve a document. That’s fine. Just explain that you cannot proceed to the next stage until they are comfortable approving the document, and try to identify and address whatever it is that worries the client.


### Types of Projects, Types of Clients

Each client and project will have different audiences, content, goals. However, projects generally fall into one of the following domains:

1. **Business to Business (B2B) sites** are marketing services or products to businesses. B2B projects tend to focus on lead generation, brand awareness, and serving existing customers.
2. **Consumer (B2C) sites** sites are selling services or products directly to individuals (consumers). B2C projects tend to focus on merchandising, conversion, and customer support.
3. **Web Applications** are only websites by co-incidence; these applications help their customers do things. App projects tend to focus on workflow, efficiency and ease of use.
4. **Non-Profit Services** usually function similarly to a B2B or B2C site, depending whether they serve the public directly, or are oriented to other organizations, companies or funders.
5. **Membership Organization sites** combine elements of direct-to-buyer marketing, web applications, brand awareness, and serving members. Imarc has created many such sites for state CPA associations in the United States.




## Pre-production

In this section:

* Purpose of this activity
* Background research & reading
* Internal hand-off and team briefing

### Purpose of this activity
Have you ever stood up to speak, with no idea what to say? Yes? That's for wedding toasts. Everybody else does their homework. Before you kick off with the client, you need to have a good understanding of *who* the client is, *what* they are trying to do, and *how* you’re going to help them do it.

### Background research and reading
Do your homework.

Start with the proposal or statement of work. It defines the project scope, suggests features and functionality, and usually includes quite a lot of background research and client goals.

The proposal was created by Business Development, who have probably spent weeks or months building a rapport with the client and understanding their needs. Use that to your advantage! It's an excellent source of intelligence about the client's goals and needs.

Be sure you can answer:

* What was proposed
* What the client does, and their competitive environment
* What the client most likely needs
* Who is the audience for the site or app you are designing
* How many hours are budgeted for your work
* What are the milestones and key dates for the project (talk to your Producer)
* Required or desirable features mentioned in the proposal

Make a list of all activities and deliverables that were proposed, and make sure they fit within the time budget defined in the proposal. With your Producer, decide who on the Imarc team will perform the activities.


### Internal hand-off and team briefing

There will usually be a formal hand-off from the sales team to the production team. Before this, make a list of outstanding questions you have from your background research. The hand-off is your chance to ask the sales team for answers or ideas. They may not have the answer, but they probably can help you figure out who on the client team you can ask. Remember, the sales team has been working with the client for weeks or months already — they know a lot. Use it.




## Discovery, Research & Planning

In this section:

+ Discovery Kick-off Meeting
+ Research Activities
+ Reporting to Client


### Discovery Kick-off Meeting
You'll start with a meeting (best) or conference call (acceptable) with the client stakeholder team. 90 minutes is a good amount of time to budget for this initial meeting (complex projects may need more). At the kickoff, you'll discuss the project goals, their current business environment and growth objectives, review client’s current site, and identify competitor sites and exemplars for follow-up. (This is often a precursor to a full Competitive Analysis.)


This meeting serves several purposes: 

1. **Process**. You'll introduces the client to our process, the activities we'll be doing together, and the deliverables they can expect to see.
2. **Expectations**. Explain to the client what kind of information you need, how you will present work, and how and when they will provide feedback. Many clients are worried about how much time they'll need to put in; give them the best guidance you can.
3. **Start Discovery**.  You and the client team will review and refine the project goals, audiences, objectives, content, functionality, competitors and benchmarks.

You should prepare an agenda, and provide it the client *before* the meeting. This agenda should contain a list of discussion topics, such as:

+ Identify participants, stakeholders, content sources, and reviewers
+ Business overview, including services, customers and market situation
+ Goals and priorities
+ Known challenges
+ Target audiences
+ Competitors
+ Best practices in content, layout, navigation, workflow, and SEO

As larger projects often have many goals, yet do not have unlimited time and resources, it’s important to prioritize goals. A group card sort activity with the core client team (3–6 people) can be very effective in both establishing priorities and in ensuring the entire client team is in agreement on them.

##### Template:

</div>


### Research Activities
Depending on budget and goals, a number of research activities may be incorporated into a project.

Most are *qualitative*, meaning they depend heavily upon the expertise and experience of the researchers—for example, interviews and hallway testing. Some are *quantitative*, meaning they are designed to produce a measurable result — for example, surveys and analytics. Designing meaningful quantitative research takes time, budget and substantial expertise; few projects actually require this, but the ones that do will benefit greatly.


####  Interviews
Interviews are an effective way to rapidly gain understanding of a project’s audiences, goals, requirements, constraints, and available resources.

Interviews almost always turn up new information, issues and objectives. Whether you are talking to stakeholders, users, or customers, your job is to understand and document their pain, aspirations and requirements.

##### Stakeholder Interviews
Stakeholder interviews have two objectives:

* Uncover the desires and goals of each decision maker involved in the project
* Identify differences and gain consensus among the decision makers

Stakeholders often mistake their own needs for their users’ needs. It’s our job to help align stakeholder’s goals with our users’ needs.

Often, the needs of different stakeholders must be balanced or prioritized. Interviews help us make informed recommendations, and our clients to make informed decisions (and, often as not, compromises).

Even if the client’s senior stakeholders aren’t in every meeting, the client team and strategy team should be aware of all people with decision making or veto authority.

When estimating time requirements for interviews, be aware that preparing to interview senior stakeholders effectively is staff- and time-intensive. Expect to spend twice as long preparing, and to get half the time you can get from others.

Some organizations will have people who are in daily contact with users or customers, and have valuable insight into what makes them “tick”. Customer service and technical support teams are often treasure troves of insight, with “on the ground” knowledge dwarfing that of sales and marketing personnel.


##### Customer or User Interviews
By talking to users or customers, we can learn not just what users are doing, but why. The better we understand their motivations, the better we can fulfill their needs.

Interviews can explore concrete items, such as user interface, document flow, feature importance, technical knowledge, or devices used (pc, tablet, phone…). But to be most effective, interviews should explore more fundamental issues.

User interviews can take place in person or remotely. We create a script and a list of questions to ensure consistency.

</div>

####  Competitive Analysis

You should understand how your client's competitors use their online presences, learn from good practices and avoid their mistakes. Look for patterns and best practices in content, layout, navigation, workflow, SEO, and social media.

You should look for patterns and best practices among:

* *Content:* Who is it written for, and why? How do they persuade visitor? What is the style?
* *Layout:* What is typical of page density, visual impact, and calls to action?
* *Navigation structure:* What forms of navigation are used? (main, breadcrumbs, footer, etc). Is it consistent? What kind of language is used? Is it discoverable?
* *Workflows:* If the user can conduct tasks (shopping, service sign-up, share content, etc), how does it work and how does it further the user’s goals? Is it easy? Is it delightful?
* *SEO:* What pages are indexed? What meta and title info are used? Is there a sitemap.xml or robots.txt, and if so, what do they indicate?

Beware! Just because something commonly is done a certain way does not mean it is the *best* way. You should use your own judgement; the goal of a competitive analysis is not to comply with the lowest common denominator, but to *find the very best practices*.

</div>

####  Surveys
Use surveys to gather information from a large number of participants, yielding quantitative results.

Questions should be close-ended (multiple choice, Yes/No, True/False). This makes it easy for participants to respond, and easier for us to analyze. For example, “We found that 83% of participants prefer to book their ferry ride online between 11am and 2pm on weekdays.”

> *Caution:* Surveys can only answer the questions we know to ask; unlike interviews and usability testing, they rarely produce novel findings.

Watch out for confirmation bias creeping into survey design and interpretation.

>	*A note on incentives:* Some clients may wish to offer an incentive to participants. When included with the invitation (for example, an Amazon gift code redeemable **regardless of participation**), this can increase participation rates by up to 19%. However, the promise of an incentive after completion has **not** been found to be effective, nor has participation in a lottery or raffle.

####  Web Analytics

We review web analytics to better inform decisions, and to set a baseline to measure the site's performance in the future. You'll look at user activity, page flows, content popularity, and traffic sources.

**Topics include:**

+ **Behavior:** Bounce rates and top bounce pages, page depth, loyalty, task completion rate
+ **Content:** Top pages, search terms, important content with puzzlingly low access rates
+ **Social:** Traffic sources, popular content
+ **Visitor Technology:** Browsers and versions, commonest devices
+ **Traffic Sources and Search Keywords:** Relative mix of traffic sources, keywords used in organic search
+ **Events:** Correlate offline events to visits or conversions
+ **SEO:** Audit use (and mis-use) of meta description tags, title tags, headlines, image alt text, sitemap.xml health, 301 redirects, appropirate use of keyword. (See [Imarc Wiki: SEO](http://wiki.imarc.net/SEO) for guidance.)

We also identify the most important performance metrics that the client should follow in the future. The exact metrics will vary from project to project, but in general we will define several general and specific indicators:

+ **General Performance:** 3–4 trackable, standard metrics for the site overall which will help the client understand where their site is performing well, or needs improvement. For example, natural search referrals, length of visit, depth of visit, bounce rate, etc.

+ **Specific Indicators:** 2–3 KPIs or event triggers that can be used to measure *conversions* (e.g., ”Request a Quote“ form submissions, course sign-up.); *value* (e.g., average order total…); or *behaviors* (e.g., Visitor loyalty and recency, days & visits to purchase, checkout abandonment rate, task completion rate…).

#### Card Sorts

Projects often have many goals, yet do not have unlimited time and resources. A group card sort activity can be very effective in both establishing priorities and in ensuring the entire client team is in agreement on them.

A small-group card sort is performed in person with the core client team (3–6 people). Cards are prepared in advance with all known project goals, and blanks are available to create new ones. The team is asked to sort the goals into groups (typically “High”, “Medium”, and “Low”). Not only do priorities emerge, but the conversation within the client team clarifies why cards go into each group.

![Sample card sort](http://handbook.imarc.net/img/strategy/cardsort.jpg)

If the stakeholder group is very large or geographically scattered, an online card sort may be appropriate. This also allows us to segment participants into “core” and “advisory” groups for separate analysis; if significant differences are found, this should be immediately raised and addressed with the client.

This technique is also effective at prioritizing **audiences** or **brand attributes**. 

An “open sort” exercise, in which card groups are created on the fly by participants, is very useful for organizing information. (But be aware that *creating* groups and *finding content* in groups are different cognitive tasks; use a tree testing tool such as TreeJack to test content findability, not a card sort.)

### Reporting to Client

How you report your findings to the client will vary, but the purpose does not: You need the client to know what you found so they will understand your decisions, and you need to give them a chance to correct or expand upon the results. No research is perfect; if your client doesn't have *anything* to say about it, something is wrong!

Common formats include:

* **Oral presentation** is great for small projects with a limited amount of discovery. Your clients are likely the main knowledge-holders in the project and you just want to be sure that you correctly understood everything you heard from them.
* **Slides** (the dreaded “PowerPoint deck”) are useful to present the summary of quantitative research such as surveys or web analytics, and in presenting highly visual findings such as personas or competitive site reviews.
* **Written findings reports** take the most time to prepare, and the most time for a client to absorb, but allow you to go into greath depth and provide nuanced interpretation. Preparing a written report usually takes as many hours as all the research that preceeded it.

## User Experience & Interaction Design
In this section:

* Experience Kickoff
* Wireframes
* Prototyping
* Usability Testing

###  Experience Kickoff

The experience kickoff is an open discussion that explores design and user interface concepts by looking at concrete examples. You and the project's lead designer will lead the client through a review of key goals and audiences, brand personality and tone, content and messaging, page density, color palettes, navigation styles, animations, photography, etc. 

You'll find yourself answering some common questions:

+ How progressive or conservative should our design be? 
+ How much content do we have? How dense should our pages be?
+ What navigation type(s) do we feel our users are most comfortable with?
+ Do we guide users tightly or loosely?
+ Are we conversational in our site messaging?
+ Does liberal use of imagery help us or hurt us?

This exercise sparks conversations around design that gives Imarc’s creative team insight into the visual direction they should head, and the UX and client teams with a common grounding in the messaging, content and navigation models that will work well for the client's audience and goals.

Work with the designer to prepare the experience kickoff website. You'll need to provide:

* Summary of key findings or business goals
* Audiences and key messages
* Benchmark websites, both within the client's industry and from outside

Meet with the designer before the kickoff to decide who will lead the meeting. Usually, you'll divide up the session, with the designer focusing on visual elements and the UX/strategist focusing on goals, audiences and content.

If the meeting is remote, be sure your producer has reserved a conference room, a dial-in and screen share for you, and has sent the screen share and dial-in to all the client team members.

### Wireframes
<!--
- Strengths and Weaknesses, When to use or not use
- Content considerations
- Process: [wiki.imarc.net/Wireframe_Process](http://wiki.imarc.net/Wireframe_Process)
-->

A wireframe is a low fidelity representation of a design that connects the underlying conceptual structure (information architecture) to the visual design of the website. A wireframe should clearly show:

+ the main groups of **content**,
+ the structure of **information**,
+ the available **functions or actions**,
+ a basic visualization of the **user interface**. 

Wireframes are useful for rapidly iterating on the underlying functional design a web page or application. It helps to visualize ideas and to gain consensus among stakeholders. The wireframe's simplified, colorless aesthetic allows us to focus on content and function instead of being distracted by creative design.

Wireframes usually are annotated to describe behaviors, functionality, and content needs. 

**Always use real content.** Using Latin text (“lorem ipsum”) will speed up your wireframing, but it allows you (and your client) to skip thinking through content needs. That rarely turns out well. It bears repeating: **always use real content**.

#### Limitations
Wireframes aren't perfect. Some common problems (and solutions) include:

* **They can constrain the designer from finding novel solutions.** <br>
*Solution:* Invite the designer to work with you to discuss and sketch initial ideas, and make sure the designer gives you the thumbs up before you present your work to the client.
* **They can't show interaction.** <br>
*Solution:* Reference live examples of interactions, or build a quick prototype for reference.
* **They are overkill for simple pages.** <br>
*Solution:* Given content by the client, Imarc's front-end developers are very good at creating the neccessary layouts. Skip the wireframe and put the time somewhere more valuable.

#### Tips on presenting, getting feedback and approvals

Before you show the wireframes, repeat for the client's benefit the goals the wireframe must accomplish, show the site map that underlies it, and remind them that the wireframe is not a creative design. 

Share the wireframe and walk through it. Don't just give a real estate tour from top to bottom; instead show how each element accomplishes one of the goals of the page. 

* **BAD:** "There are three content blocks in this row, each with a button."
* **GOOD:** "Your site has three key audiences with very different interests, so this page has unique content for each, designed to draw them deeper into the site where we can customize the content to their needs."

Remember, it's *your* job tell your client how to give you feedback. Explain that if they think something doesn't work, we need to understand *why* it doesn't work. They don't have to have a solution (that's your job), just to *define the problem*.

Keep in mind that your client has deep expertise and knowledge of their business and audiences. Listen carefully to what they have to say. Don't be afraid to ask questions and dig deeper.

As noted earlier in this document, you'll need to get an approval at some point. Enlist your producer for help. It's your job to clearly tell the client what they are approving, what will happen after they do, and answer their questions.

###  Usability Testing
The best way to find out what does or does not work well is by asking real people to try it.

Common kinds of testing:

* **Informal Testing:** Sometimes called “hallway testing,” this answers simple questions quickly: just recruit a passer-by and ask them to do a specific task. It's is informal, easy, cheap, fast, and not very rigorous. However, project stakeholders tend to distrust test results when they conflict with pre-existing beliefs.
* **Heuristic Evaluation:** An experienced UX specialist evaluates an existing user interface against usability principles and provides recommendations for improvement. This is informal and relatively quick, but depends upon an experienced evaluator. It is well-suited to aggressive project schedules.
* **Structured Usability Testing:** This is what most people think of when they hear "usability testing": You create a list of tasks to test, put people in front of the web site (app, prototype, etc.), and record what happens. It's time intensive, but the payoff is this produces the most new insights of any form of testing.

When planning a structured usability test, it’s best to start with a list of questions that need answering, such as “can users easily sign up for a workshop?” or “does breaking the checkout into three steps make it easier to use than the current site?”

Next, create a formal task list and script, recruit up to 5 users ([at most](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-many-test-users/)), and one at a time sit with each of them in front of a computer and ask them to perform specific tasks. One person runs the test, being as careful as possible not to lead the tester; other team members may observe by screen-share and one-way audio.

The script helps to ensure consistency; video recording the screen lets us revisit the tests.

## Appendix: Tools

The most important qualification for a tool is *fitness for purpose*. We constantly evaluate alternatives; if you think a tool shows promise, try it out; if it works well, add it to Handbook.


### Wireframes and Site Maps

[OmniGraffle Pro](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle) is used for site maps and wireframes. In the past, we've also had good results from [Mockingbird](https://gomockingbird.com) and [Balsamiq](http://www.balsamiq.com).

We have created an OmniGraffle stencil with our most commonly used wireframe components. You can get the latest version from our fileserver.


### Documents

[Keynote](http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/) is our preferred on-screen presentation tool. If cross-platform compatibility will be required, we use PowerPoint. ([Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) is handy for web-based presentations, but HTML & CSS knowledge is a prerequisite.)

We frequently use [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com) for collaborative authoring and editing. Google Docs should not be created or edited using personal accounts; *only* use your imarc.com account.

We use [Word](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/word) for some documents, but are not great fans of it. We appreciate Word's .docx file format for its superior change tracking capabilities.

Branded templates for Word and Keynote can be downloaded from [our intranet](http://internal.imarc.net/).


### Research and Testing Tools

**Surveys:** [Survey Monkey](http://surveymonkey.com) for user surveys.

**Tree Testing:** [Treejack](http://www.optimalworkshop.com/treejack.htm) for testing content structure and navigation.

**Card Sorting:** [OptimalSort](http://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort.htm) is used for remote card sort exercises. ([Here are some others](http://www.measuringux.com/CardSorting/); we haven't yet tried most of them.)

**Screen Recording:** [Camtasia](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html) for conducting in-person user testing. Camtasia records the session screen and audio.

**Screen Sharing:** [Join.me](http://join.me) for remote user testing (and presentation).

**A/B Testing:** [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/) is our go-to for testing variations of an existing website. (See also this [A/B Test Sample Size Calculator](http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/sample-size.html).)
