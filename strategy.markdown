# Strategy

This document outlines iMarc’s strategy process and deliverables. This incorporates practices from UX, IA, needs analysis, and business development.

iMarc is a full service web agency located north of Boston. Learn more at http://imarc.net.



## Process

The strategy process is provided to clients who have signed a proposal which includes a specified time and cost budget for strategy. Proposals that do not explicitly define a strategy budget or scope should be turned down by the strategy team.

Strategy work should clarify the project for the client and production team while focusing on a positive end-user experience.

The strategy lead is responsible for delivering change orders when the scope of the strategy phase, or the production work that strategy is defining, changes.


### Kickoff

Strategy begins with an internal handoff meeting between the proposal author and strategy team.

The proposal author is responsible for notifying the client that project leadership is changing hands and the lead strategist is now their primary point of contact.


### Goals

The goal of all strategy activity is to produce a blueprint for the application or site that iMarc has contracted to deliver.

Strategy sanity checks recommendations from the proposal with client needs.  Strategy deliverables override recommendations from the proposal where necessary and agreed upon by the client.

When proposals specify time or cost budget for production, strategy deliverables must define a project that can be easily produced within those limitations.


### Approval

The output of strategy are concrete reference documents. Deliverables are approved by the client and by the iMarc producer who will ultimately lead the production phase.

Approved deliverables are handed off to the project’s producer. 

The strategy lead is responsible for notifying the client that project leadership is changing hands and the Interactive Producer is now their primary point of contact.





## Research Activities

Depending on budget and goals, a number of research activities may be incorporated into a project.


### Stakeholder Interviews (Qualitative)

Identify and gain consus among the client's decision makers. Even if these people aren't in every meeting, the client team and strategy team should be aware of all people with decision making or veto authority.

Speak with key stakeholders. Understand and document their pain, aspirations, and goals for the project.  
- What are the success metrics?
- Who are the audience segments?
- What do their customers or users need?
- Is there any market research?
- What will make them successful?
- What challenges do they face?

Stakeholder interviews often turn up new information, issues and objectives.


### Competitive Analysis (Qualitative)

A competitive analysis can give customers a view of how their competitors fare on the web. This analysis can include:

- Layout - page density, visual impact
- Navigations structure analysis - what forms of navigation are used? (main, breadcrumbs, footer, etc). Is it consistent?
- Content - how are they using content to persuade visitor? What is the style? who is it written for, and why?
- SEO audit - pages indexed, meta and title info, sitemap XML and robots.txt audit 


### Surveys (Quantitative)

Surveys allow us to gather information from a large number of participants, yielding results in quantitative terms. For example, *We found that 83% of participants prefer to book their ferry ride online between 11am and 2pm on weekdays.*

Questions are asked in a close-ended fashion (multiple choice, Yes/No, True/False). This makes it easy for participants to respond, and easier for us to analyze. 

Surveys are most effective at measuring things we know about. They are ineffective at discovering the unknown.

iMarc typically uses Survey Monkey, which has fairly good tools for finding patterns in responses and on-the-fly cross-tabulation.


### User Interviews (Qualitative)

Speak to current and/or perspective users by conducting contextual, non-biased interviews. This can relate to user interface components, design elements, document flow, feature importance, technical knowledge and more. 

User interviews can take place in person or remotely over the phone with screen sharing software. Like stakeholder interviews, user interviews tend to result in new discoveries.




## Deliverables

A **deliverable** is a document or similar work product you can give to someone.

**Project Scope** is defined by a *Proposal* or a *Statement of Work*. "Scope" means how many hours are allocated to the project's phases, and any mandatory features. Scope is restated in the *Functional Requirements* or *Production Specification*

**Project Requirements** are defined by a *Functional Requirements* or a *Production Specification* document.

**Project Implementation** is defined by a *Production Specification*.


### Proposal
 - Is created by BizDev
 - Is a sales tool
 - Defines project scope
 - Recommends features and functionality
 - Includes background research & discovery


### Statement of Work (SOW)
 - Is created by Interactive Producers or BizDev
 - Is not a sales tool. SOWs are used for existing clients who don't need to be sold on iMarc as a vendor.
 - Defines project scope
 - Defines features and functionality
 - Usually does not include background research & discovery
 - Usually does not require a specification before production


### Functional Requirements

A 5-10 page document for smaller projects with a production scope less than 200 hours.

The requirements document takes about 60 hours to produce, including all discovery, research and meetings.

 - Created by Strategy team or delivered by the client
 - Not a sales tool
 - Restates scope of production phase
 - Must be approved by the client
 - Describes business needs driving the project
 - Describes front-end functionality (what, not how)
 - Typically includes the following [supporting documents](#SupportingDocuments)
   - [site map](#SiteMap)
   - [homepage narrative](#HomepageNarrative)
 - Reviewed by Interactive Producer before finalization
 - May include or reference change orders vs the proposal scope

(Sometimes called a [Functional Requirement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_requirement).)


### Production Specification

A 15–80 page document for projects scoped to a 200+ hours production schedule. iMarc used to call this a "Functional Requirements Document (FRD)".

Typically takes 90–170 person-hours to produce, including all discovery, research and meetings.

 - Created by Strategy team
 - Not a sales tool
 - Restates scope of production phase
 - Must be approved by the client
 - Includes everything in a Requirements document, *plus*:
   - Describes back-end functionality such as CMS tools, fields and relationships; databases; network and server infrastructure; external systems the site works with; security considerations.
   - Must be reviewed by Interactive Producer and an engineer before finalization
   - May also be reviewed on an ad hoc basis by UX, Creative, BizDev or others identified by Producer or Strategist

(This is somewhat akin to a [Functional Specification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_specification). However, it's not as detailed. See also Joel Spolsky's [Painless Functional Specifications](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000036.html) series.)



## Supporting Documents

Functional Requirements and Production Specification documents commonly include:


### Discovery Report

A brief document summarizing findings, including:

 - Business overview, including services and customers
 - Target audiences
 - Project goals, prioritized
 - Project challenges
 - Notable trends in site analytics
 - Client interview and/or survey results (if conducted)
 - Baseline performance/analytics (including conversion rates, if possible)
 - Recommendations

The discovery document is typically 2-6 pages. The primary purpose of this document is to ensure all stakeholders are aligned to the same objectives and priorities. Secondarily, it serves as a "checklist" of sorts for the next documents: site map, wireframes, and requirements or specifications.


### Analytics Report

2–10 page document that summarizes website analytics indentifying the most important data pertaining to the upcoming project. The primary purpose of this document is to convey user activity and trends in an easy to understand summarization.


### Homepage Narrative

Brief, 1-2 page document that defines all content, features and functionality required for the homepage. This simple list and description acts as a starting point for the design and creative phase.


### Site Map

Diagram showing the relationship of a web site's information and organization of content. 
  - iMarc uses site maps to convey content hierarchy, CMS controlled content, and template usage.
  - Site maps create a navigational backbone for a website.

*Example:*
![Sample Site map](img/strategy/sitemap.png)


### Content Outline

The content outline supplements a Site Map. A content mimics the the organization of the site map, providing 1-2 sentences about the purpose and goal of each page. Typically a component of a Functional Requirements document.

*Example:*
![Sample Content Outline](img/strategy/content_outline.png)


### Wireframe

User interface illustration stripped of all presentational style. It's a bit of a "sneak preview" of the site for our clients, and helps them visualize the ideas being discussed and get buy-in from stakeholders.

 - Allows for rapid, efficient UI iteration
 - Conveys what a screen does
 - We often create multiple wireframes express various parts of the site
 - Sometimes depict multiple parts of a single workflow; we call these *Storyboards*
 - Almost always annotated to describe behaviors, functionality, and content needs.
 - Should not depict creative design. However, design is inexlicably linked to layout, so you should consult a UX Engineer or Designer on wireframes. Often, they will be the principal authors.

*Example:*

## Software & Templates

iMarc currently uses [OmniGraffle Pro](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle) for site maps and wireframes, but previously used a program called Inspiration. OmniGraffle is Mac-only software.

(At least one Interactive Producer uses Microsoft Visio for Windows; OmniGraffle can import/export those files.)

iMarc generally uses the [Konigi stencil set](http://konigi.com/tools/omnigraffle-wireframe-stencils) for wireframes. This provides a remarkably complete set of user interface components for web sites, applications and mobile devices. We also have created an "iMarc Objects" stencil with some commonly used elements, including iMarc-branded metadata blocks.

We usually write reports and specifications in [Word](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/word), but are not married to it. We prefer Word's .docx file format for its superior change tracking capabilities. (You can download branded templates from [our intranet](http://internal.imarc.net/).) We've used [Pages](http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/) too; the revision tools aren't as robust but it's much better at handling images and styles, and less prone to crashing.


### Document Metadata

Strategy deliverables should contain some combination of the following meta information.

 - **Client bame:** Example: "iMarc LLC"
 - **Document title:** What is this and what role does it play in the project? Example: "Product Detail Page Wireframe"
 - **Updated date:** When was this wireframe last updated? Example: "September 14, 2012"
 - **Version number:** A collaboration aid. Example: "v7"
 - **Author:** Each document has one author. The last person to touch the document is the author of record and is responsible for its contents. Example: "David Tufts"
 - **Revision notes:** What changed in this revision; mainly used in requirements and specification documents.
