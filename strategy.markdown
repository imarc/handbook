## Goals

> “Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.”
> –Sun Tzu

The *goal* of all strategy activity is to produce a clear and concise blueprint for an application or website. **Strategy work aims to clearly define the project for the client and production team while focusing on a positive end-user experience.**

Strategy work will sanity check recommendations from the proposal against actual client needs. Strategy deliverables override recommendations from the proposal where necessary and agreed upon by the client.

When proposals specify time or cost budget for production, strategy deliverables must define a project that can be easily produced within those limitations.



## Key Terms


Deliverable
: A document or similar *work product* you can give to someone.

Activity
: An task you *do*. It is *not* a deliverable. (It may result in one.)

Time Req
: The number of hours required to produce an activity or deliverable, for an *average-sized project*.

Scope
: The *total hours* allocated to the project, and mandatory *features*. Scope is defined by a [Proposal](strategy#Proposal) or a [Statement of Work](strategy#StatementofWork), and should be restated in the Requirements or Specification.

Requirements
: What the end product must do. Defined by a [Functional Requirements](strategy#FunctionalRequirements) or a [Production Specification](strategy#ProductionSpecification) document.

Implementation
: How the end product must work. Defined by a [Production Specification](strategy#ProductionSpecification).


## Process

This Handbook page focuses on the strategy process. For context, it's helpful to understand Imarc's larger software development life cycle.

### Software Development Life Cycle

Imarc's typical software development life cycle ensure's that we are creating the best possible end-product for our clients. The steps involved in the process are:

Listen
:   Gather Requirements, Evaluate, Conceptualize

Strategize
:   Analyze, Interviews, Wireframing, Site mapping

Design
:	Creative, Visuals, Branding

Develop
:	Programming, Databases, Markup

Test
:	Quality Assurance, Security Scans

Release
:	Launch, Support, Maintain

The cycle repeats as requirements change or enhancements are requested.

### Strategy Process

The strategy process is provided to clients who have engaged Imarc by approving a proposal which includes a specified time and cost budget for strategy. Smaller projects that do not explicitly define a strategy budget or scope should bypass the strategy team and go directly to a production team.

The overall process typically looks something like this:

1. Define project objectives
1. Conduct discovery and report findings
1. Define content and tools via spec doc(s)

Strategy begins with an internal handoff meeting between the proposal author and strategy team.

Before strategy work begins, the proposal author is responsible for notifying the client that project leadership is changing hands and the producer or lead strategist is now their primary point of contact.


### Team Members and Roles

During large-scale strategy engagements, the ideal strategy team will consist of:

Producer
:	Sets high-level milestones;
	Consulted on spec and strategy deliverables;
	Approves spec doc before production

Strategist
:	Leads the strategy phase;
	Manages most client meetings;
	Responsible for presenting deliverables and adhering to timeline;
	Sets day-to-day tasks and due dates for team;
	Delegates tasks to other team members;
	Delivers change orders when the scope of the strategy phase, or the production work that strategy is defining, changes

UX Engineer
:	Conducts [discovery activities](strategy#DiscoveryActivities) and produces deliverables and supporting documents, delegated by the Strategist

Designer
:	May participate in discovery and interviews;
	Is consulted on wireframes

Engineer
:	Handles engineering tasks and/or research, delegated by the Strategist

The Designer, Engineer and UX Engineer(s) will stick with the project after the strategy phase is complete. This ensures that the Engineer and Designer are familiar with the plan and are prepared to execute. The UX Engineer provides consistency, shepherding the vision architected during the strategy phase and forged in production.


### Approvals

The output of strategy are concrete reference documents. Deliverables are approved both by the client and by the Imarc project producer.

If the client also engages Imarc to develop the project, the strategy lead is responsible for notifying the client that project leadership is changing hands. The Producer is the primary point of contact during the production phase. The Strategist typically withdraws to an advisory-only role (i.e., answering questions about spec or scope, reviewing initial creative work, and helping with QA after development).



## Discovery Activities

> “Research is formalized curiosity. It is poking and prying with a purpose.”
> –[Zora Neale Hurston](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zora_Neale_Hurston)

Depending on budget and goals, a number of research activities may be incorporated into a project.

Most are qualitative, meaning they depend heavily upon the expertise and experience of the researchers—for example, interviews and hallway testing. Some are quantitative, meaning they are designed to produce a measurable result—for example, surveys and analytics. Designing meaningful quantitative research takes time, budget and substantial expertise; few projects actually require this, but the ones that do will benefit greatly.


### Core Discovery

Objective
:	Clearly define the goals of the project and stakeholder needs, quickly and efficiently, for projects of very low complexity

Tasks
:	Meet with client team to review and prioritize goals, audiences, and benchmarks; discuss content, features, and functionality. Report findings to client for validation.

Deliverables
:	Short findings document (1–3 printed pages)

Time Req
:	10 hours

Templates
:	<smb://fileserver/files/UX/templates/Discovery/>

For projects such as redesigning an existing site or creating a simple informational or marketing site, a focused and fast discovery process can be highly effective. This may not require a dedicated Strategist and may be conducted by the producer, engineering and creative groups.

This starts with a 90-minute conference call or meeting with the client stakeholder team (2-5). Imarc and the client team discuss the project goals, their current business environment and growth objectives, review the current site, and benchmark competitor sites and exemplars.

Next, Imarc creates a short report of findings, and presents those findings to the client for validation. This helps to ensure internal stakeholders agree on the project's objectives and priorities, _before_ discovering disagreements the hard way.

**Topics include:**

+ Business overview, including services, customers and market situation
+ Prioritized goals
+ Known challenges
+ Target audiences
+ Competitors
+ Best practices in content, layout, navigation, workflow, and SEO



### Detailed Discovery

Objective
:	Clearly define and prioritize the goals of the project, stakeholder needs, and audiences.

Tasks
:	Meet with client team to review and prioritize goals, audiences, and benchmarks; discuss content, features, and functionality; identify key challenges. Report findings to client for validation.

Deliverables
:	Findings document (3–8 pages)

Time Req
:	30 hours

Templates
:	<smb://fileserver/files/UX/templates/Discovery/>

For projects such as a major re-design of a large site, or a project with many stakeholders and high visibility, an in-depth discovery process will yield better results. This is typically lead by a Strategist, with the assistance of the producer, UX, engineering, and creative groups.

This starts with a 90- to 120–minute conference call or meeting with the client stakeholder team. Imarc and the client team discuss the project goals, their current business environment and growth objectives. We'll also discuss the client's current site, and identify competitor sites and exemplars for follow-up. (This is often a precursor to a full [Competitive Analysis](#CompetitiveAnalysis).)

As larger projects often have many goals, yet do not have unlimited time and resources, it's important to prioritize goals. A group [card sort](#GoalsCardSort) activity with the core client team (3–6 people) can be very effective in both establishing priorities and in ensuring the entire client team is in agreement on them.

Lastly, Imarc creates a concise report of findings, and presents those findings to the client for validation. This helps to ensure internal stakeholders agree on the project's objectives and priorities, _before_ discovering disagreements the hard way. The report often includes recommendations for specific follow-up research, and for outstanding decisions that must be made.

**Topics include:**

+ Business overview, including services, customers and market situation
+ Prioritized goals
+ Known challenges
+ Target audiences
+ Competitors
+ Best practices in content, layout, navigation, workflow, and SEO

<div markdown="1" class="inlinedetailnotreallysemanticisit">
#### Goals Card Sort

Projects often have many goals, yet do not have unlimited time and resources. A group card sort activity can be very effective in both establishing priorities and in ensuring the entire client team is in agreement on them.

A small-group card sort is performed in person with the core client team (3–6 people). Cards are prepared in advance with all known project goals, and blanks are available to create new ones. The team is asked to sort the goals into groups (typically "High", "Medium", and "Low").  Not only do priorities emerge, but the conversation within the client team clarifies _why_ cards go into each group.

<figure markdown="1">
<figcaption>Sample card sort result</figcaption>
![Sample card sort](img/strategy/cardsort.jpg)
</figure>

If the stakeholder group is very large or geographically scattered, an online card sort may be appropriate. This also allows us to segment participants into "core" and "advisory" groups for separate analysis; if significant differences are found, this should be immediately raised and addressed with the client.

**Other applications:** This technique can is also effective at prioritizing audiences or brand attributes. An "open sort" exercise, in which the groups are created on the fly by participants, is very useful for organizing. (But be aware that creating groups and finding content in groups are different cognitive tasks; use a tree testing tool such as TreeJack to test content findability, not a card sort.)

### Interviews

Objective
:	Interviews are an effective way to rapidly gain understanding of a project's audiences, goals, requirements, constraints, and available resources.

Tasks
:	Vary by interview subjects and objective; see below for notes on stakeholder and user interviews.

Deliverables
:	Concise summary of findings (3–4 printed pages)

Time Req
:	30 hours for 3–4 interview sessions with 2–4 interview subjects each

Templates
:	<smb://fileserver/files/UX/templates/Interviews/>
(Both internal stakeholder and user interview templates are provided)

Interviews almost always turn up new information, issues and objectives. Whether you are talking to stakeholders, users, or customers, your job is to understand and document their pain, aspirations, and requirements.

<div markdown="1" class="inlinedetailnotreallysemanticisit">
#### Stakeholder Interviews
Stakeholder interviews have two objectives:

* Uncover the desires and goals of each decision maker involved in the project
* Identify differences and gain consensus among the decision makers

Stakeholders often mistake their own needs for their users' needs. It's our job to help align stakeholder's goals with our users' needs.

Often, the needs of different stakeholders must be balanced or prioritized. Interviews help us make informed recommendations, and our clients to make informed decisions (and, often as not, compromises).

Even if the client's senior stakeholders aren't in every meeting, the client team and strategy team should be aware of all people with decision making or veto authority.

**Topics include:**

+ What are the success metrics?
+ Who are the audience segments?
+ What do customers or users need?
+ Is there any market research?
+ What will make the client successful?
+ What challenges do they face?

When estimating time requirements, be aware that preparing to interview senior stakeholders effectively is staff- and time-intensive.
</div>

<div markdown="1" class="inlinedetailnotreallysemanticisit">
#### User or Customer Interviews

By talking to users or customers, we can learn not just what users are doing, but *why*. The better we understand their motivations, the better we can fulfill their needs.

Interviews can explore concrete items, such as user interface, document flow, feature importance, technical knowledge, or devices used (pc, tablet, phone…). But to be most effective, interviews should explore more fundamental issues.

User interviews can take place in person or remotely. We create a script and a list of questions to ensure consistency.

**Topics include:**

+ What do users want? What are they _really_ trying to do?
+ What frustrates them?
+ What makes them happy?
+ Is the task we're fulfilling their primary goal, or is it part of something else?
+ Are there other tools or competitors they might consider?
+ What is the environment where they use the system? What else are they doing while using the site/app/system?

Some organizations will have people who are in daily contact with users, and have valuable insight into what makes users "tick". Customer service and technical support teams are often treasure troves of insight, with "on the ground" knowledge dwarfing that of sales and marketing personnel. Their experience is invaluable, especially for consumer-facing organizations, or if for any reason we can't talk to the actual end users.

### Competitive Analysis

Objective
:	Understand how our clients' competitors use their online presences, learn from good practices and avoid their mistakes.

Tasks
:	Look for patterns and best practices in content, layout, navigation, workflow, SEO, and social media.

Deliverables
:	Specific recommendations for the project, summarized in a concise findings document (2–4 printed pages)

Time Req
: 8 hours

Template
:	<smb://fileserver/files/UX/templates/competitive analysis/>


Typically we look for patterns and best practices among:

+ **Content:**  Who is it written for, and why? How do they persuade visitor? What is the style?
+ **Layout:** What is typical of page density, visual impact, and calls to action?
+ **Navigation structure:** What forms of navigation are used? (main, breadcrumbs, footer, etc). Is it consistent? What kind of language is used? Is it discoverable?
+ **Workflows:** If the user can conduct tasks (shopping, service sign-up, share content, etc), how does it work and how does it further the user's goals? Is it easy? Is it delightful?
+ **SEO audit:** What pages are indexed? What meta and title info are used? Is there a sitemap.xml or robots.txt, and if so, what do they indicate?

*Caution:* Just because something commonly is done a certain way does not mean it is the *best way*. You should use your own judgement; the goal of a competitive analysis is not to comply with the lowest common denominator, but to find the very best practices.


### Web Analytics and Metrics Baseline

Objective
:	Help clients understand where their site has performed well or poorly, and establish a baseline to measure the effectiveness of their site in the future.

Tasks
:	Explore trends and patterns in user activity, content, and page flows.

Deliverables
:	2–3 page summary of most important analytics data findings. This establishes a baseline for future measurement.

Time Req
:	8 hours

Templates
:	<smb://fileserver/files/UX/templates/analytics and metrics> <br> process: [wiki.imarc.net/Analytics_Checklist](http://wiki.imarc.net/Analytics_Checklist)

We review web analytics to better inform decisions during planning, design and development, and set a baseline to measure the site in the future. We look at user activity, page flows, content popularity, and traffic sources. It is necessarily backwards-looking.

**Topics include:**

+ **Behavior:** Bounce rates and top bounce pages, page depth, loyalty, task completion rate
+ **Content:** Top pages, search terms, important content with puzzlingly low access rates
+ **Social:** Traffic sources, popular content
+ **Visitor Technology:** Browsers and versions, commonest devices
+ **Traffic Sources and Search Keywords:** Relative mix of traffic sources, keywords used in organic search
+ **Events:** Correlate offline events to visits or conversions
+ **SEO:** Audit use (and mis-use) of meta description tags, title tags, headlines, image alt text, sitemap.xml health, 301 redirects, appropirate use of keyword. (See [Imarc Wiki: SEO](http://wiki.imarc.net/SEO) for guidance.)

We also identify the most important performance metrics that the client should follow in the future. The exact metrics will vary from project to project, but in general we will define several general and specific indicators:

+ **General Performance:** 3–4 trackable, standard metrics for the site overall which will help the client understand where their site is performing well, or needs improvement. For example, natural search referrals, length of visit, depth of visit, bounce rate, etc.

+ **Specific Indicators:** 2–3 KPIs or event triggers that can be used to measure *conversions* (e.g., ”Request a Quote“ form submissions, course sign-up.); *value* (e.g., average order total…); or *behaviors* (e.g., Visitor loyalty and recency, days & visits to purchase, checkout abandonment rate, task completion rate…).



### Surveys

Objective
:	Gather information from a large number of participants, yielding quantitative results.

Tasks
:	Design a set of closed-ended questions, distribute the survey to users (see [survey tools](strategy#SurveysandTesting) below), analyze the results.

Deliverables
:	1–3 page summary of findings.

Time Req
: 32 hours per survey.

Questions should be close-ended (multiple choice, Yes/No, True/False). This makes it easy for participants to respond, and easier for us to analyze. For example, *We found that 83% of participants prefer to book their ferry ride online between 11am and 2pm on weekdays.*

*Caution:* Surveys can only answer the questions we know to ask; unlike interviews and usability testing, they rarely produce novel findings.

Watch out for [confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) creeping into survey design and interpretation.

**A note on incentives:** Some clients may wish to offer an incentive to participants. When included with the survey invitation itself (for example, an Amazon gift code redeemable regardless of participation), this can increase participation rates by 19%. However, the promise of an incentive after completion has not been found to be effective, nor has participation in a lottery or raffle.

## Deliverables and Supporting Documents

> ”Only when one writes do the gaps appear and inconsistencies protrude. The act of writing turns out to require hundreds of mini-decisions, and it is the existence of these that distinguishes clear, exact policies from fuzzy ones.“
> —[Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks) *The Mythical Man-Month*, 1975.

During the strategy process, we'll refer to and create a number of deliverables. Not all deliverables are needed for every project. The commonest are described here.

Over the years, Imarc has shifted from defining the requirements for websites (or apps) only in prose, to creating more visual documents. Combined with detailed annotations or working prototypes, these better explain how a web site or apps will work.


### Proposal

A proposal is created by Business Development and is a sales tool. It defines the project scope, suggests features and functionality, and usually includes quite a lot of background research and client goals. ***Every strategy participant should read the proposal, in its entirety.***


### Statement of Work

A Statement of Work, or SOW, may be created by Business Development or a Producer. It's not a sales tool. SOWs are used for existing clients who don't need to be sold on Imarc as a vendor. An SOW defines project scope, features and functionality. It usually does not include background research & discovery.


### Site Map

Summary
:	Diagram showing the relationship of a web site's information and organization of content.

Time Req
: 10 hours (minimum, varies by scope of project)

Templates
:	<smb://fileserver/files/UX/templates/site maps> <br> process: [wiki.imarc.net/Sitemap_Process](http://wiki.imarc.net/Sitemap_Process)

A sitemap is a diagram that:

+ Conveys content hierarchy and labeling
+ Denotes CMS-controlled content and template usage
+ Creates a navigational backbone for a website

Imarc sitemaps tend to be a tree-style diagram such as this:

<figure markdown="1">
[![Tree-style sitemap diagram](img/strategy/sitemap-example.png)](img/strategy/sitemap-example.png)
</figure>

Sometimes, if it helps comprehension and clarity, we'll use other styles. Regardless of the style used, an Imarc sitemap follows certain conventions:

+ Every page on the site should be represented on the sitemap.
	+ Exception: List-and-view constructs, such as press releases, events calendars, and product catalogs, are instead represented by a multi-page icon.
+ The page names and their order on the sitemap are significant – site menus will match this.


### Experience Kickoff

Summary
: Explore design and user interface concepts with client.

Time Req
: 4-8 hours

Templates
:	<smb://fileserver/files/UX/templates/experience kickoff/>

Based on the project’s detailed discovey, imarc and project stakeholders will explore design and user interface
concepts – we’ll look at websites together! Some of these explored concepts can include page density, site messaging,
color palettes, navigation styles, animations, etc. We will find ourselves answering some common questions:

+ How progressive or conservative should our design be?
+ How much content do we have? How dense should our pages be?
+ What navigation type(s) do we feel our users are most comfortable with?
+ Are we conversational in our site messaging?
+ Does liberal use of imagery help us or hurt us?

The results of the kickoff will help imarc make more informed decision in the [wireframing stage](strategy#Wireframe).


### Wireframe

Summary
: User interface and content illustration stripped of all presentational style.

Time Req
: 8–10 hours each

Templates
:	<smb://fileserver/files/UX/templates/wireframes/> <br> process: [wiki.imarc.net/Wireframe_Process](http://wiki.imarc.net/Wireframe_Process)

A wireframe is a low fidelity representation of a design that connects the underlying conceptual structure (information architecture), to the visual design of the website. A wireframe should clearly show:

+ the main groups of **content**,
+ the structure of **information**,
+ the available **functions or actions**,
+ a basic visualization of the **user interface**.

The wireframe allows us to rapidly iterate the underlying functional design a web page or application. It helps to visualize ideas and to gain consensus among stakeholders. The wireframe's simplified, colorless aesthetic allows us to focus on content and function instead of being distracted by creative design.

Wireframes usually are annotated to describe behaviors, functionality, and content needs. **Always use real content.** Using Latin text (“lorem ipsum”) may speed up your wireframing, but it allows you (and your client) to skip thinking through content needs. That rarely turns out well. It bears repeating: **always use real content**.

Most wireframes depict single web pages, but some may depict multiple screens in a complex interaction or workflow. We call these **storyboards**. The time required is cumulative: a four-screen storyboard will take 32-40 hours of work to create, revise and approve.

<!--
### Prototypes

Summary
:	An interactive mockup of a user interface that shows how it will work
``
Time Req
:	_special_

Rapid prototypes can be used to quickly test interface or design interaction concepts. They bridge the gap between static documents such as site maps and wireframes, and the actual user experience of a web site or app.

At Imarc, we use prototypes to test novel interfaces, gain user feedback, or to explain an interaction to a client before committing to intensive development.

A UX Engineer creates an interactive mockup; it is barely styled ("low fidelity"), uses real content if possible, and implements the minimum functionality possible to test the concept. We review the prototype with the client or users, identifing what works and what needs to change. There may be several rounds of iteration, improving and expanding functionality until the interface is well-defined.

The prototype then serves as a blueprint for creative design and coding.

#### Example Prototype
This is a screen recording of a working HTML prototype. This mocks up how searching and adding would work in a simple password manager web app:

### Functional Requirements

Summary
:	A 5–10 page document for projects of low technical complexity. This typically aligns to projects with production scope of 150–250 hours.

Time Req
:	22-24 hours

Templates
:	https://github.com/imarc/strategy.imarc.net/tree/master/docs/template

This document should restate scope of production phase (which often changes somewhat during discovery), and must be approved by the client. It describes business needs driving the project, and describes front-end functionality (what, not how). It typically includes a [Site Map](strategy#SiteMap) and [Homepage Wirefame](strategy#Wireframe). It should be reviewed by the Producer before finalization, and may include or reference change orders vs the proposal scope.


### Production Specification

Summary
:	A 15–80 page document for projects of high technical complexity. This typically aligns to projects with production scope of *over 250 hours*.

Time Req
:	 72–150 hours

Templates
:	https://github.com/imarc/strategy.imarc.net/tree/master/docs/template

Like a Functional Requirements document, it's created by a Strategy team in close collaboration with the client. A Production Specification is needed for projects of high complexity. Examples include integrating with external systems; building on new-to-Imarc platforms; or custom hosting or security requirements. On these projects, Engineers, Producers, UX Engineers and Creative will be involved in developing the specification with the Strategy team.

This document restates the scope of production and must be approved by the client. It includes everything in Functional Requirements, *plus*:

+ Describes back-end functionality such as CMS tools, fields and relationships; databases; network and server infrastructure; external systems the site works with; security considerations.
+ Must be reviewed by the Producer and an engineer before finalization.
+ May also be reviewed on an ad hoc basis by UX, Creative, BizDev or others identified by the Producer or Strategist.

(A Production Spec is somewhat akin to a formal [Functional Specification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_specification). However, it's not as detailed: we are not building the Space Shuttle, and there is room for improvisation. Our developers have tremendous domain knowledge; it's important to let them exercise it and explore novel approaches. See also Joel Spolsky's [Painless Functional Specifications](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000036.html) series.)



## Usability Testing

> “If we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would it?”
> –Albert Einstein

The best way to find out what does or does not work well is by asking *real people* to try it.

Usability testing can be used to improve existing systems, or while developing new ones. We engage in several types of testing.

### Hallway Testing

Objective
:	Answer simple usability questions quickly and cheaply.

Tasks
: Recruit a passer-by and ask them to do a specific task.

Deliverables
:	N/A; conducted during design or development as needed.

Time Req
:	0\.5 hours per task per person

[Hallway testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing#Hallway_testing) is informal, easy, cheap, fast, and not very rigorous. It answers simple questions quickly.

</div>

### Expert Evaluation

Objective
:	Create oral or written suggestions for improvements in a design or system.

Tasks
: Evaluate an existing user interface against usability principles and provide recommendations for improvement.

Deliverables
:	Concise recommendations for changes (1–2 printed pages)

Time Req
:	8 hours

Experienced usability specialist evaluates the user interface (current or planned), judging compliance with recognized usability principles, and provides oral or written suggestions for improvements. This is informal and relatively quick, but depends upon an experienced evaluator. It is well-suited to aggressive project schedules.

</div>

### Structured Usability Testing

Objective
:	Make a site or application easier to use and more effective at its purpose.

Tasks
: Create a list of tasks to test; put humans in front of the web site, app, or prototype; give them the tasks; record what happens.

Deliverables
:	Findings document with recommendations (3–5 printed pages)

Time Req
:	40 hours per round, with 4–5 users, and written usability report and recommendations. (Does not include time to create a [prototype](#Prototypes).)

Usability testing involves putting actual people in front of a real or mocked up site, giving them tasks, and seeing what happens. This tends to produce the most new insights of any form of testing.

It's best to start with a list of questions that need answering, such as *can users easily sign up for a workshop?* or *does breaking the checkout into three steps make it easier to use than the current site?*

Next, create a formal task list and script, recruit 4–5 users (rarely more), and one at a time sit with each of them in front of a computer and ask them to perform specific tasks. One person runs the test, being as careful as possible not to lead the tester; other team members may observe by screen-share and one-way audio.

The script helps to ensure consistency; video recording the screen lets us revisit the tests.

## Quality Assurance

Objective
:	Ensure the site or application meets the requirements laid out in the [Functional Requirements](strategy#FunctionalRequirements) or [Production Specification](strategy#ProductionSpecification) document. Find bugs.

Tasks
: Test every function and content object described in the wireframes/requirements against expected behavior, verify the presence of all pages in the site map, and make sure the required content is present and correct.

Deliverables
:	Issues should be entered as tasks in Imarc's [Workshop](https://workshop.imarc.com). The Producer will traffic them.

Time Req
:	N/A (not budgeted with strategy)

After design and development, before launch, Imarc employees who were not involved in creating the site assess the site for compliance with the project requirements, for general bugs, and for usability issues.

QA serves as a "last pass" to catch anything missed during production.



## Tools

> “Man is a tool-using animal. Without tools he is nothing, with tools he is all.”
> –[Thomas Carlyle](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/96126/Thomas-Carlyle)

The most important qualification for a tool is *fitness for purpose*. We constantly evaluate alternatives; if you think a tool shows promise, try it out; if it works well, add it to Handbook.


### Wireframes and Site Maps

[OmniGraffle Pro 6](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle) is used for site maps and wireframes. In the past, we've also had good results from [Mockingbird](https://gomockingbird.com) and [Balsamiq](http://www.balsamiq.com).

We have created an OmniGraffle stencil with our most commonly used wireframe components. You can get the latest version at GitHub:
<https://github.com/imarc/omnigraffle-stencils/>

<!--
There are a number of tools we've used to create prototypes, including Keynote, Omnigraffle, and of course JavaScript and PHP. Here are some guides:

* [How to Create Rapid Prototypes Using Keynote](http://keynotopia.com/tutorials/)

### Reports and Specs

We publish many documents and reports as web-native documents on [strategy.imarc.net](https://strategy.imarc.net). This uses a custom [document publishing system](http://wiki.imarc.net/Strategy_Docs_Publishing) inspired by GitHub Pages, but with many customizations for our own process. See the wiki for details.

We sometimes use [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com) through Imarc's Google Apps account. Google Docs should not be created or edited using personal accounts.

We use [Word](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/word) for some documents, but are not great fans of it. We appreciate Word's .docx file format for its superior change tracking capabilities.

[Keynote](http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/) is preferred for on-screen presentation. If cross-platform compatibility will be required, we use PowerPoint.

Branded templates for Word and Keynote can be downloaded from [our intranet](http://internal.imarc.net/).


### Research and Testing Tools

**Surveys:** [Survey Monkey](http://surveymonkey.com) is used to conduct user surveys.

**Tree Testing:** [Treejack](http://www.optimalworkshop.com/treejack.htm) is used for testing content structure and navigation.

**Card Sorting:** [OptimalSort](http://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort.htm) is used for remote card sort exercises. ([Here are some others](http://www.measuringux.com/CardSorting/); we haven't yet tried most of them.)

**Screen Recording:** [Camtasia](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html) is used for conducting in-person user testing. Camtasia records the session screen and audio.

**Screen Sharing:** [Join.me](http://join.me) or [GoToMeeting](http://www.gotomeeting.com/fec/) are used for remote user testing (and presentation).



### Document Metadata

Strategy deliverables should contain an appropriate combination of the following meta information.

Client
:	Example: *Imarc LLC*

Project
:	Example: *Website Redesign*

Document Title
:	Example: *Product Detail Page Wireframe*

Version
:	A number used as collaboration aid to identify a specific document. If changes are made to a published or shared document, the version number should increase.
Example: *v7*

Last Updated
:	Full date that the document was last modified. (In OmniGraffle, using the <%ModificationDate%> variable is recommend.)
Example: *September 4, 2012*

Author
:	Each document has one author. The last person to touch the document is the author of record and is responsible for its contents.
Example: *David Tufts*
