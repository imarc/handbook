# Strategy

This document outlines iMarc’s strategy process, methods, and deliverables. The strategy process incorporates practices from UX, IA, needs analysis, and even sales and business development.

iMarc is a full service web agency located north of Boston. Learn more at http://imarc.net.




## Process

The strategy process is provided to clients who have signed a proposal which includes a specified time and cost budget for strategy.

### Beginning Strategy

Strategy begins with an internal handoff meeting between the proposal author and strategy team. Proposals that do not call out a strategy budget or scope should be turned down by the strategy team.

The proposal author then makes it clear to the client that leadership is changing hands and the lead strategist is now their primary point of contact.




### Goals

Strategy builds upon previous discovery and must fulfill the terms of the proposal or SOW. Strategy should sanity check recommendations from the proposal with client needs, overriding those recommendations and changing course where necessary and agreeable with the client.

Strategy produces a plan for production teams that is realistically possible within all project constraints. The work should clarify the project for the client and center around a positive end user experience.

When proposals specify a time or cost budget for the production phase, strategy deliverables must define a project that can be easily produced within those limitations.

The strategy lead is responsible for delivering change orders when the scope of the strategy phase, or the production work that strategy is defining, changes.




### Approval

The output of strategy are concrete reference documents. Deliverables are approved by the client and iMarc producer.

Approved deliverables are handed off to the project’s Interactive Producer. The strategy lead then makes it clear to the client that leadership is changing hands and the Interactive Producer is now their primary point of contact.




## Process: How We (Usually) Do This

*In Progress*

### Discovery 
 - Kickoff Meeting
 - Interviews with Stakeholders, Clients, Customers, etc
 - Web Analytics
 - Audience Analysis: Who they are, what they need or want, how we can provide that

### Defining the Site or App 
 - Site Mapping
 - Wireframeing
 - Content Plan
 - Analytics Plan

### Writing the Spec

 - Spec = Sitemap + Wireframes + Content Plan + Analytics Plan + //lots of detail//
 - Functional vs Technical 




## Deliverables

**Project Scope** is defined by a *Proposal* or by a *Statement of Work*. "Scope" means how many hours are allocated to the project's phases, and any mandatory features. Scope is restated in the *Functional Spec* or *Technical Spec*

**Project Requirements** are defined by a *Functional Spec* or a *Technical Spec*.

**Project Implementation** is defined by a *Technical Spec*.




### Proposal
 - Is created by BizDev
 - Is a sales tool
 - Defines project scope
 - Recommends features and functionality
 - Includes background research & discovery




### Statement of Work (SOW)
 - Is created by Interactive Producers or BizDev
 - Is not a sales tool. SOWs are used for existing clients who don't need to be sold on iMarc as a vendor.
 - Defines project scope
 - Defines features and functionality
 - Usually does not include background research and discovery
 - Usually does not require a specification before production




### Functional Specification

A 5-10 page document for smaller projects with a production scope less than 200 hours.

The Functional Spec takes about 60 hours to produce, including all discovery, research and meetings.

 - Created by Strategy team or delivered by the client
 - Not a sales tool
 - Restates scope of production phase
 - Must be approved by the client
 - Describes business needs driving the project
 - Describes front-end functionality (what, not how)
 - Typically includes the following [supporting documents](#SupportingDocuments)
   - [site map](#SiteMap)
   - [homepage narrative] (#SiteMap)
 - Reviewed by Interactive Producer before finalization
 - May include or reference change orders vs the proposal scope




### Technical Specification

A 15–80 page document for projects scoped to a 200+ hours production schedule. iMarc used to call this a "Functional Requirements Document (FRD)".

Typically takes 90–170 person-hours to produce, including all discovery, research and meetings.

 - Created by Strategy team
 - Not a sales tool
 - Restates scope of production phase
 - Must be approved by the client
 - Includes everything in a Functional Specification, plus:
   - Describe back-end functionality such as CMS tools, fields and relationships; databases; network and server infrastructure; external systems the site works with; security considerations.
   - Must be reviewed by Interactive Producer and an engineer before finalization
   - May also be reviewed on an ad hoc basis by UX, Creative, BizDev or others identified by Producer or Strategist




## Supporting Documents

The Functional Specification or Technical Specification commonly include:




#### Discovery Report
Brief document summarizing findings, including:
 	- Business overview, including services and customers
 	- Target audiences
 	- Project goals, prioritized * (e.g., new business development, recruiting, membership growth, industry influence...) *
 	- Project challenges * (e.g., competitors, company differentiators, technical isssues...) *
 	- Notable trends in site analytics
 	- Client interview and/or survey results * (if conducted) *
 	- Baseline performance/analytics * (including conversion rates, if possible) *
 	- Prioritized objectives
 	- Initial recommendations

The discovery document is typically 3-6 pages long. The primary purpose of this document is to ensure all stakeholders are aligned to the same objectives and priorities. Secondarily, it serves as a "checklist" of sorts for the next documents: site map, wireframes, specifications.




#### Homepage Narrative

Brief, 1-2 page document that defines all content, features and functionality required for the homepage. This simple list and description acts as a starting point for the design and creative phase.




#### Site Map

Diagram showing the relationship of a web site's information. They are crucial to project planning and scope and are used throughout the project lifecycle.
 	- iMarc uses site maps to convey content hierarchy, dynamic and CMS controlled content, and template usage.
 	- Site maps create a navigational backbone for a website.

*Example:*
![Sample Site map](img/sitemap.png)




#### Wireframe

User interface illustration stripped of all presentational style.
 	- Allows for rapid, efficient UI iteration
 	- Convey what a screen does, not what it looks like
 	- However, design is inexlicably linked to layout, so a UX Engineer or Creative should be consulted on wireframes, and often will be the principal authors
 	- Multiple wireframes are often produced to express various parts of the site

*Example:*
![Example of Wireframe](img/wireframe.png)




### Software & Templates

iMarc currently uses [OmniGraffle Pro](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle) for site maps and wireframes, but previously used a program called Inspiration. OmniGraffle is Mac-only software.

(At least one Interactive Producer uses Microsoft Visio for Windows; OmniGraffle can import/export those files.)

iMarc generally uses the [Konigi stencil set](http://konigi.com/tools/omnigraffle-wireframe-stencils) for wireframes. This provides a remarkably complete set of user interface components for web sites, applications and mobile devices.

We usually write reports and specifications in [Word](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/word) (which has particularly good change tracking), but are not married to it. (You can download branded templates from [our intranet](http://internal.imarc.net/).) We've used [Pages](http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/) too; the revision tools aren't as robust but it's much better at handling images and styles, less prone to crashing.




## Tips

*In Progress*

Energistically e-enable superior communities through enterprise-wide portals. Progressively re-engineer interoperable ROI for tactical results. Holisticly brand technically sound alignments for real-time data.






# User Experience

This document outlines major user experience terminology, methods and best practices 
employed by iMarc. The goal of user experience is to design and develop web sites 
armed with the knowledge of users' identities, pain, and tasks. iMarc is a full service 
web development and design firm located north of Boston. Learn more at http://imarc.net.

## Research Activities

When beginning a project, it's important to execute proper research prior to any creative or
development production. Depending on budget, a number of research levels can be incorporated
into a project:

 - [stakeholder interviews](#StakeholderInterviews)
 - [competitive analysis](#CompetitiveAnalysis)
 - [surveys (quantitative data)](#SurveysQuantitativeData)
 - [user interviews (qualitative data)](#UserInterviewsQualitativeData)
 - [usability testing (prototypes)](#UsabilityTestingPrototypes)

### Stakeholder Interviews

As is customary with all iMarc projects, speaking with key stakeholders in the customer's
company is essential to understand the pain, aspirations, and goals of the website. What are
the success metrics? Who are the audience segments? Does any existing market research exist?

### Competitive Analysis

A competitive analysis can give customers a view of how their competitors fare on the web. 
This analysis can include:

- layout
  - page density
  - visual impact
- navigations structure analysis 
  - what forms of navigation are used? (main, breadcrumbs, footer, etc). Is it consistent?
- light SEO audit
  - pages indexed
  - meta and title info
  - sitemap XML and robots.txt audit 

### Surveys (Quantitative Data)

Surveys allow us to gather information on a large number of participants, yielding results in quantitative terms. For example, *We found that 83% of participants prefer to book their ferry ride online between 11am and 2pm on weekdays.*

Typically, questions are asked in a close-ended fashion (multiple choice, Yes/No, True/False). This allows for faster answering easy analysis. iMarc prefers to use Survey Monkey, a tool that easily displays result patterns.


### User Interviews (Qualitative Data)

Everyone does not interact with the web in the same manner. Speaking to current and/or 
perspective users is very helpful in a website's planning stages. By conducting contextual, 
**non-biased** interviews with users, we can gain insight into what works and what does not. This can relate 
to UI components, design elements, document flow, feature importance, technical knowledge and more. 
User interviews can take place in person or remotely over the phone with screen sharing software. 
**Some common exercises within user interviews include:**

- questionnaires
  - favorite sites
  - web usage
- 4-up site gut-reactions
- [feature card sorting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_sorting)
  - card sorting allows us to see users' preferred feature-sets and also preferred task workflows

*An example of remote card sorting using websort.com*

## Site maps

Site maps are diagrams meant to show the relationship of a web 
site's information. They are crucial to project planning and scope and are used 
throughout the project lifecycle. 

iMarc uses site maps to convey content hierarchy, dynamic and CMS controlled 
content, and template usage. Additionally, site maps create a navigational 
backbone for a website.

*Below is an example site map*

![Example Site map](img/sitemap.png)


### Anatomy

iMarc divides site maps up to three layers depending on the project. 

 **Main site content**
> Lists out all content in a hierarchy

 **Dynamic content and templates**
> This layer illustrates areas of the site that pertains to search results, external system integration, user input, access restrictions, editable front–end content
 **Templates**
> Lists the template number being used (related to wireframes)


### Software

iMarc currently uses OmniGraffle for site maps but previously used a program 
called Inspiration.


## Wireframes

Wireframes are user interface diagrams stripped of all presentational style, 
leaving nothing but a layout of the document – this allows for rapid and 
efficient UI iterations. They're used to communicate what a screen "does" 
rather than what it "looks like". **The wireframing process takes place after 
research and discovery and before creative design.** 

Projects benefit from wireframes in various ways: 

- Creative is given a foundation upon which they begin design rounds. Depending on project's complexity, there may be many wireframes for many important templates.
- Developers can visually understand user interface components rather than guessing the convention and behavior from a requirements document. 
- Clients and the iMarc BizDev team use them to validate requirements.

There are varying degrees of wireframes ranging from a low, conceptual wireframe to a high 
fidelity wireframe. Different projects will use different types of wireframes
depending on the purpose it serves in relation to a goal.

### Low Fidelity/Reference Zone Wireframe

A reference zone wireframe is an abstract representation of a website template illustrating 
where large blocks of content exist (primary nav, utility nav, callout, etc). The use of 
these wireframes is to gain perspective from the client on where they want major items,
such as navigation and sidebars. UI components and content are not included. These wireframes 
are also ideal for customers who do not have ample budget but can be challenging for some as
they are not accustomed to think in the abstract.

![Example of Low-Fidelity Wireframe](img/wireframe_reference.png)

### High Fidelity Wireframe, or 'Wireframe'

A high fidelity wireframe is a very detailed layout, complete with different UI
elements such as links and buttons. It is a detailed mockup that shows actual
potential text and link names and can even incorporate color, gradients, and 
images. Annotations of UI components and their behaviors is optional. When an 
employee at iMarc refers to a generic 'wireframe' they are referring to a high 
fidelity wireframe.

![Example of High-Fidelity Wireframe](img/wireframe.png)

### Template Information

 **Wireframe title**
> Each wireframe should be given a title relevant to the template
 **Updated date**
> When was this wireframe last updated?
 **Version number**
> Give the wireframe a version number
 **Annotations**
> Annotations describe behaviors, functionality, etc

![Wireframe title, date, annotations](img/wireframe_meta.png)

### Software and Stencil Set

iMarc generally uses OmniGraffle for wireframes along with the 
[Konigi stencil set](http://konigi.com/tools/omnigraffle-wireframe-stencils). 
This set includes a plethora or user interface components used in iMarc projects.



### Usability Testing (Prototypes)
