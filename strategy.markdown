# Strategy

This document outlines iMarc’s strategy process and deliverables. This incorporates practices from UX, IA, needs analysis, and business development.

iMarc is a full service web agency located north of Boston. Learn more at http://imarc.net.



## Goals

The goal of all strategy activity is to produce a blueprint for the application or site that iMarc has contracted to deliver.

Strategy sanity checks recommendations from the proposal with client needs.  Strategy deliverables override recommendations from the proposal where necessary and agreed upon by the client.

When proposals specify time or cost budget for production, strategy deliverables must define a project that can be easily produced within those limitations.



## Key Terms


Deliverable
: A document or similar *work product* you can give to someone.

Activity or Task
: Something you *do*. It is not a deliverble.

Scope
: The number of *hours* are allocated to the project, and mandatory *features*. Scope is defined by a [Proposal](#proposal) or a [Statement of Work](#statementofworksow), and should be restated in the Requirements.

Requirements
: What the end product must do. Defined by a [Functional Requirements](#functionalrequirements) or a [Production Specification](#productionspecification) document.

Implementation
: How the end product must work. Defined by a [Production Specification](#productionspecification).



## Process

The strategy process is provided to clients who have signed a proposal which includes a specified time and cost budget for strategy. Proposals that do not explicitly define a strategy budget or scope should be turned down by the strategy team.

Strategy work should clarify the project for the client and production team while focusing on a positive end-user experience.

The overall process typically looks something like this:

1. Define project objectives *(know where you are going)*
1. Audit baseline current site or app *(know where you are coming from)*
1. Conduct discovery, research, interviews, and testing, then report findings *(know what you do and don't have to work with)*
1. Explore needed content and tools *(know what you need to pack)*
1. Write the blueprint *(map and plan your trip)*

Strategy begins with an internal handoff meeting between the proposal author and strategy team.

The proposal author is responsible for notifying the client that project leadership is changing hands and the lead strategist is now their primary point of contact.


### Team Members and Roles

During large-scale strategy engagements, the ideal strategy team will consist of:

Producer
:	Sets high-level milestones; <br>
	Consulted on spec and strategy deliverables; <br>
	Approves spec doc before production

Strategist
:	Leads the strategy phase; <br>
	Manages most client meetings; <br>
	Responsible for presenting deliverables and adhering to timeline; <br>
	Sets day-to-day tasks and due dates for team; <br>
	Delegates tasks to other team members; <br>
	Delivers change orders when the scope of the strategy phase, or the production work that strategy is defining, changes

Designer
:	Is consulted on wireframes

Engineer
:	Handles tech-tasks and/or tech-research, delegated by the Strategist

UX Engineer
:	Usually creates wireframes and other visual deliverables, delegated by the Strategist

As we transition to the creative and production phases, the Strategist hands the reins over to the Producer and withdraws to an advisory-only role (i.e., answering questions about spec or scope, reviewing initial creative work, and helping with QA after development).

The Designer, Engineer and UX Engineer(s) stick with the project through production; their roles and responsibilities may change a bit. This ensures that the Engineer and Designer are familiar with the plan and are prepared to execute, and the UX Engineer provides consistency, shepherding the vision architected during the strategy phase and forged in production.

### Approvals

The output of strategy are concrete reference documents. Deliverables are approved both by the client and by the iMarc project producer.

The strategy lead is responsible for notifying the client that project leadership is changing hands and the Interactive Producer is now their primary point of contact.




## Discovery Activities

Depending on budget and goals, a number of research activities may be incorporated into a project. Most are qualitative, meaning they depend heavily upon the expertise and experience of the researchers. Some are quantitative, meaning they are designed to produce a measurable result. Designing meaningful quantitative research takes a lot of time and requires substantial expertise; few projects actually require this, but the ones that do will benefit greatly.

The end of the Discovery process should result in delivering a [Discovery Report](#discoveryreport) to the client. (Sometimes a presentation format may be used instead; set appropriate client expectations based on the exact discovery activities you plan to undertake.)


### User Interviews

Locate, contact and talk to the *actual users* of the site or application, conducting contextual, unbiased interviews. More of an art than a science, this is used to find out not just what users are doing, but *why*. The better we understand the users' motivations, the better we can fulfill their needs.

User interviews can take place in person or remotely over the phone, with or without screen sharing. We create a script and a list of questions to ensure consistency. Typically, the results are summarized for the client in a findings report.

Interviews can explore concrete items, such as user interface components, design elements, document flow, feature importance, technical knowledge, and devices used (pc, tablet, phone…).  But to be most effective, interviews should explore more fundamental issues.

+ What do users want? What are they really trying to do?
+ What frustrates them?
+ What makes them happy? 
+ Is the task we're fulfilling their primary goal, or is it part of something else? 
+ Are there other tools or competitors they might consider? 
+ What is the environment where they use the system? 
+ If they're mobile, are they walking around a noisy factory floor, or driving from office to office? 
+ If they're not mobile, do they use a desktop PC, a laptop with a big screen, laptop with tiny screen?

Some organizations will have people who are in daily contact with users, and have valuable insight into what makes users "tick". Customer service and technical support teams are often treasure troves of insight, with "on the ground" knowledge dwarfing that of sales and marketing organizations. Their experience is invaluable, especially for consumer-facing organizations, or if for any reason we can't talk to the actual end users.


### Stakeholder Interviews

Identify and gain consus among the client's decision makers. Even if these people aren't in every meeting, the client team and strategy team should be aware of all people with decision making or veto authority.

Speak with key stakeholders. Understand and document their pain, aspirations, and goals for the project.  

+ What are the success metrics?
+ Who are the audience segments?
+ What do their customers or users need?
+ Is there any market research?
+ What will make them successful?
+ What challenges do they face?

Stakeholder interviews often turn up new information, issues and objectives.

However, stakeholders often mistake their own needs for their users' needs. It's our job to help align stakeholder's goals with our users' needs.


### Competitive Analysis

A competitive analysis can give customers a view of how their competitors fare on the web. Typically we look for patterns and best practices among:

+ **Layout:** What is typical of page density, visual impact, and calls to action?
+ **Navigation structure:** What forms of navigation are used? (main, breadcrumbs, footer, etc). Is it consistent? What kind of language is used? Is it discoverable?
+ **Workflows:** If the user can conduct tasks (shopping, service sign-up, share content, etc), how does it work and how does it further the user's goals? Is it easy? Is it delightful?
+ **Content:**  Who is it written for, and why? How do they persuade visitor? What is the style?
+ **SEO audit:** What pages are indexed? What meta and title info are used? Is there a sitemap.xml or robots.txt, and if so, what do they indicate?

Caution: Just because something commonly is done a certain way does not mean it is the *best way*. You should use your own judgement; the goal of a competitive analysis is not to comply with the lowest common denominator, but to find the very best practices.

A competitive analysis should culminate in delivering specific recommendations for the project.


### Surveys

Surveys allow us to gather information from a large number of participants, yielding results in quantitative terms. For example, *We found that 83% of participants prefer to book their ferry ride online between 11am and 2pm on weekdays.*

Questions are asked in a close-ended fashion (multiple choice, Yes/No, True/False). This makes it easy for participants to respond, and easier for us to analyze. 

Surveys are most effective at measuring things we know about. They are ineffective at discovering the unknown.




### Usability Testing

iMarc engages in several types of testing. In order of increasing rigorousness (and time, effort and cost):

Hallway Testing
:	During design or development, pull in a passer-by and ask them to do a task. This is informal, easy, cheap, fast, and not very rigorous. It answers simple questions quickly.

Heuristic Evaluation
:	Experienced usability team members evaluate the user interface (current or planned), judging compliance with recognized usability principles, and provide oral or written suggestions for improvements. This is informal and relatively quick, but depends upon an experienced evaluator. It is well-suited to aggressive project schedules. <br> &nbsp;  &nbsp; A good starting point for this is Jakob Nielsen's [10 Heuristics for User Interface Design](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) and [How to Conduct a Heuristic Evaluation](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-conduct-a-heuristic-evaluation/) articles; Abby Covert's [Information Architecture Heuristics](http://www.slideshare.net/AbbyCovert/information-architecture-heuristics) is great too.

Quality Assurance
:	After design and development, iMarc employees who were not involved in creating the site asseses the site for common issues and best practices. (This is not typically part of the strategy process, although strategists often assist in this work.) Similar to Heuristic Evaluation, except it serves as a "last pass" to catch anything missed during production.

Structured Usability Testing
:	This involves putting actual people in front of a real or mocked up site, giving them tasks, and seeing what happens. This tends to produce the most new insights of any form of testing. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; We create a formal task list and script, recruit a number of users (typically [5 users](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/), and [rarely more](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-many-test-users/)), and one at a time sit with each of them in front of a computer and ask them to perform specific tasks. One person runs the test, being as careful as possible not to lead the tester; other team members may observe by screen-share and one-way audio. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The script helps to ensure consistency, video recording the screen lets us revisit the tests. 





## Deliverables and Supporting Documents

During the strategy process, we'll refer to and create a number of deliverables. Not all deliverables are needed for every project. The commonest are described here.

### Proposal

A proposal is created by Business Development and is a sales tool. It defines the project scope, suggests features and functionality, and usually includes quite a lot of background research and client goals. *Every strategy participant should read the proposal.*


### Statement of Work (SOW)

A statement of work may be created by Business Development or an Interactive Producer. It's *not* a sales tool. SOWs are used for existing clients who don't need to be sold on iMarc as a vendor. An SOW defines project scope, features and functionality. It usually does not include background research & discovery, and rarely requires a [specification](#TechnicalSpecification) before production.


### Functional Requirements

A 5-10 page document for smaller projects with a production scope less than 200 hours. This should take about 60 hours to produce, including all discovery, research and meetings. This document is created by Strategy team (on rare occasion, a complete FRD is provided by the client). It's not a sales tool.

An FRD should restate scope of production phase (which often changes somewhat during discovery), and must be approved by the client. It describes business needs driving the project, and describes front-end functionality (what, not how). It typically includes a [site map](#SiteMap) and [homepage narrative](#HomepageNarrative). An FRD should be reviewed by Interactive Producer before finalization, and may include or reference change orders vs the proposal scope.


### Production Specification

A 15–80 page document for projects scoped to a 200+ hours production schedule. It typically takes 90–170 person-hours to produce, including all discovery, research and meetings.

Like an FRD, it's created by a Strategy team in close collaboration with the client. It restates the scope of production and must be approved by the client. It includes everything in an FRD, *plus*:

+ Describes back-end functionality such as CMS tools, fields and relationships; databases; network and server infrastructure; external systems the site works with; security considerations.
+ Must be reviewed by Interactive Producer and an engineer before finalization.
+ May also be reviewed on an ad hoc basis by UX, Creative, BizDev or others identified by Producer or Strategist.

(This is somewhat akin to a [Functional Specification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_specification). However, it's not as detailed: we are not building the Space Shuttle, and there is room for improvisation. iMarc's developers have tremendous domain knowledge; it's important to let them exercise it. See also Joel Spolsky's [Painless Functional Specifications](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000036.html) series.)


### Discovery Report

A brief document summarizing findings, including:

+ Business overview, including services and customers
+ Target audiences
+ Project goals, prioritized
+ Project challenges
+ Notable trends in site analytics
+ Summary of client interview and/or survey results (if conducted)
+ Summary of usability testing results (if conducted)
+ Baseline performance/analytics (including conversion rates, if possible)
+ Recommendations

The discovery document is typically 2-6 pages. The primary purpose of this document is to ensure all stakeholders are aligned to the same objectives and priorities. Secondarily, it serves as a "checklist" of sorts for the next documents: site map, wireframes, and requirements or specifications.


### Analytics Report

2–8 page document that summarizes website analytics indentifying the most important data pertaining to the upcoming project. The primary purpose of this document is to convey user activity and trends in an easy to understand summarization, to better inform decisions during planning, design and development. The secondary purpose of this document is to establish a baseline for key metrics, including (where applicable) conversions and referrals.


### Homepage Narrative

Brief, 1-2 page document that defines all content, features and functionality required for the homepage. This simple list and description acts as a starting point for the design and creative phase.


### Site Map

Diagram showing the relationship of a web site's information and organization of content. 

+ iMarc uses site maps to convey content hierarchy, CMS controlled content, and template usage.
+ Site maps create a navigational backbone for a website.

*Example:*
![Sample Site map](img/strategy/sitemap.png)


### Content Outline

The content outline supplements a Site Map. A content mimics the the organization of the site map, providing 1-2 sentences about the purpose and goal of each page. Typically a component of a Functional Requirements document.

*Example:*
![Sample Content Outline](img/strategy/content_outline.png)


### Wireframe

User interface illustration stripped of all presentational style. It's a bit of a "sneak preview" of the site for our clients, and helps them visualize the ideas being discussed and get buy-in from stakeholders.

+ Allows for rapid, efficient UI iteration
+ Conveys what a screen does
+ We often create multiple wireframes express various parts of the site
+ Sometimes depict multiple parts of a single workflow; we call these *Storyboards*
+ Almost always annotated to describe behaviors, functionality, and content needs.
+ Should not depict creative design. However, design is inexlicably linked to layout, so you should consult a UX Engineer or Designer on wireframes. Often, they will be the principal authors.

*Example:*

## Tools


### Wireframes and Sitemaps

We currently use [OmniGraffle Pro](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle) for site maps and wireframes. OmniGraffle is Mac-only software. (At least one Interactive Producer uses Microsoft Visio for Windows; OmniGraffle can import/export those files.) In the past, we've also had good results from [Mockingbird](https://gomockingbird.com) and [Balsamiq](http://www.balsamiq.com).

We generally use the [Konigi stencil set](http://konigi.com/tools/omnigraffle-wireframe-stencils) for wireframes. This provides a remarkably complete set of user interface components for web sites, applications and mobile devices.

We also have created an "iMarc Objects" OmniGraffle stencil with some commonly used elements, including iMarc-branded metadata blocks.


### Reports and Specs

We use [Word](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/word) for most reports and specs, but are not married to it. We prefer Word's .docx file format for its superior change tracking capabilities. (You can download branded templates from [our intranet](http://internal.imarc.net/).) We've used [Pages](http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/); the revision tools aren't as robust but it's much better at handling images and styles, and less prone to crashing.

We use [Keynote](http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/) when presenting on-screen.


### Surveys and Testing

To conduct user surveys, we favor [Survey Monkey](http://surveymonkey.com), which has fairly good tools for finding patterns in responses and on-the-fly cross-tabulation.

To test content structure, we've had good results with [Treejack](http://www.optimalworkshop.com/treejack.htm). (It does not handle recruiting testers, though.)

When conducting user testing, we usually record the session screen and audio using [Camtasia](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html). For remote user testing, [GoToMeeting](http://www.gotomeeting.com/fec/) is the service of choice.



### Document Metadata

Strategy deliverables should contain some combination of the following meta information.

 - **Client Name:** Example: "iMarc LLC"
 - **Document title:** What is this and what role does it play in the project? Example: "Product Detail Page Wireframe"
 - **Updated Date:** When was this wireframe last updated? Example: "September 14, 2012"
 - **Version Number:** A collaboration aid. Example: "v7"
 - **Author:** Each document has one author. The last person to touch the document is the author of record and is responsible for its contents. Example: "David Tufts"
 - **Revision Notes:** What changed in this revision; mainly used in requirements and specification documents.
