= Strategy =

This document outlines major user experience terminology, methods and deliverables employed by iMarc. The strategy process incorporates practices from user experience (UX) and information architecture (IA), with needs analysis. The goal of strategy is to produce a plan for the creative and development teams, armed with the knowledge of users' identities, pain, and tasks.

iMarc is a full service web agency located north of Boston. Learn more at http://imarc.net.




== Context is Everything: Organizational Process ==

//In a nutshell: Sales -> Strategy -> Production//


We (usually) enter after a client has signed a proposal from the Business Development team. The BizDev team does
quite a bit of discovery during the sales process, much of which is worked into the proposal (so read it!). The proposal usually defines some deliverables, and often mentions specific features or CMS tools the site should have. It's our job to both fulfill the terms of the contract, and to sanity check its recommendations with our clients needs and that of their users.

The output of strategy are concrete reference documents, approved by our clients, that are delivered to the project's Interactive Producer and the Creative and Engineering team members who will execute it. If we've done our job correctly, the contents of the requirements will surprise no one, because key team members have been consulted during
the strategy and planning process.




== Documents and Deliverables ==

This is a brief definition of the document types used by iMarc in sales, strategy and production.

**Project scope** is defined by a //Proposal// or by a //Statement of Work//. "Scope" means how many hours are allocated to the project's phases, and (usually) any mandatory features. \\
**Project requirements** are defined by a //Functional Spec// or a //Technical Spec//. (Just one.)


=== Proposal ===
 - Is created by BizDev
 - Is a sales tool
 - Defines project scope (usually as hours per phase, but sometimes as features)
 - Recommends features and functionality
 - Includes background research & discovery

=== Statement of Work ===
 - Is created by Interactive Producers or BizDev
 - Is not a sales tool (it's used for existing clients who don't need to be sold on iMarc as a vendor)
 - Defines project scope
 - Defines features and functionality
 - Does not include background research and discovery
 - Usually does not require a specification before production

=== Functional Specification ===
A short, 5-10 page document that:
 - Is created by Strategy team
 - Is not a sales tool
 - Must be approved by the client
 - Should describe the business needs driving the project
 - Must describe front end functionality (what, not how)
 - May include site maps, wireframes, diagrams or other illustrations
 - Should be reviewed by Interactive Producer before finalization
 - May include or reference change orders vs the proposal scope
 - Formerly called a "User Experience Blueprint" (deprecated, please change all references)
 - Should take fewer than 60 person-hours to produce, //including all discovery, research and meetings//

=== Technical Specification ===
A long document, anywhere from 15 to 80 pages (including diagrams & illustrations), that:
 - Is created by Strategy team
 - Is not a sales tool
 - Must be approved by the client
 - Includes everything in a Functional Specification, plus:
 - Must describe back end functionality (e.g., CMS tools, fields and relationships; databases; network and server infrastructure; external systems the site works with; security considerations; etc. )
 - Must be reviewed by Interactive Producer and an engineer before finalization
 - May also be reviewed on an ad hoc basis by UX, Creative, BizDev or others identified by Producer or Strategist
 - May include or reference change orders vs the proposal scope
 - Formerly called a "Functional Requirements Document" (deprecated, please change all references)
 - Typically takes 80-160 person-hours to produce, //including all discovery, research and meetings//

=== Supporting documents ===

Strategy projects commonly include:

==== Discovery Report ====
Brief document summarizing findings, including: 
 	- Business overview, including services and customers
 	- Target audiences
 	- Project goals, prioritized // (e.g., new business development, recruiting, membership growth, industry influence...) //
 	- Project challenges // (e.g., competitors, company differentiators, technical isssues...) //
 	- Notable trends in site analytics
 	- Client interview and/or survey results // (if conducted) //
 	- Prioritized objectives
 	- Initial recommendations

The discovery document is typically 3-6 pages long. The primary purpose of this document is to ensure all stakeholders are aligned to the same objectives and priorities. Secondarily, it serves as a "checklist" of sorts for the next documents: site map, wireframes, specifications.



==== Homepage Narrative ====
Brief, 1-2 page document that defines all content, features and functionality required for the homepage. This simple list and description acts as a starting point for the design and creative phase.



==== Site Map ====
Diagram showing the relationship of a web site's information. They are crucial to project planning and scope and are used throughout the project lifecycle. 
 	- iMarc uses site maps to convey content hierarchy, dynamic and CMS controlled content, and template usage.
 	- Site maps create a navigational backbone for a website.

==== Wireframe ====
User interface illustration stripped of all presentational style.
 	- Allows for rapid, efficient UI iteration
 	- Convey what a screen does, not what it looks like
 	- However, design is inexlicably linked to layout, so a UX Engineer or Creative should be consulted on wireframes, and often will be the principal authors
 	- Multiple wireframes are often produced to express various parts of the site

=== Software & Templates ===

iMarc currently uses [http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle OmniGraffle Pro] for site maps and wireframes, but previously used a program called Inspiration. OmniGraffle is Mac-only software.

(At least one Interactive Producer uses Microsoft Visio for Windows; OmniGraffle can import/export those files.)

iMarc generally uses the [http://konigi.com/tools/omnigraffle-wireframe-stencils Konigi stencil set] for wireframes. This provides a remarkably complete set of user interface components for web sites, applications and mobile devices.

We usually write reports and specifications in Microsoft Word (which has particularly good change tracking), but are not married to it. (You can download branded templates from [http://internal.imarc.net/ our intranet].) We've used Pages too; the revision tools aren't as robust but it's much better at handling images and styles.




== Process: How We (Usually) Do This ==

//In Progress// \\ Uniquely matrix top-line synergy whereas cooperative leadership. Monotonectally seize one-to-one best practices without alternative ideas. 




== Tips ==

//In Progress// \\ Energistically e-enable superior communities through enterprise-wide portals. Progressively re-engineer interoperable ROI for tactical results. Holisticly brand technically sound alignments for real-time data.
