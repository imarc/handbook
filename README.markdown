# Handbook

https://handbook.imarc.com

This is the source for Imarc Handbook. All changes, pull requests, etc. should be done against the *gh-pages* branch.

## Development
You can update Handbook by pushing to `gh-pages`, but you should work locally first, previewing your changes.

Handbook uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and can be viewed locally using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

If you donâ€™t have [Bundler](https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler), install it via `gem install bundler` (you only need to do this once)

Run `bundle install`

Serve Handbook locally via `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
