Handbook
========

If you're trying to find the source for the iMarc Handbook, then you're got the
right repository, but the wrong branch. Github Pages looks specifically for
'gh-pages' branches to find documention to convert with jekyll, and you're
currently looking at 'master', the default for git.


Just show me the Handbook
