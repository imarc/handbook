# Handbook

https://handbook.imarc.com

Imarc Handbook documents coding best practices. All pull requests, etc. should be done against the *gh-pages* branch.

## Development

You should work locally before commiting any code. Handbook can be viewed locally using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

If you donâ€™t have [Bundler](https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler), install it via `gem install bundler` (you only need to do this once).

Run `bundle install`

Serve Handbook locally via `bundle exec jekyll serve`

Run `npm i` to install packages and `npm run watch` to compile Sass to CSS.

### Icons

We use [Tabler SVG Icons](https://tablericons.com/).

## Deployment

You can deploy Handbook by pushing to the `gh-pages` branch. Handbook uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
